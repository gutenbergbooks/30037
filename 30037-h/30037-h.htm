<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h3>IN A HOSTILE COUNTRY</h3>
</div>
<p>Eastward out of the Torquilla Range the Burntwood
River emerged from a gorge, flowing swift and turbulent
during the spring months, shallow and murmurous
the rest of the year, to pass through a basin formed
by low mountains and break forth at last from a canyon
and wind away over the mesa. In the canyon was
being erected the huge reservoir dam which was in the
future to store water for irrigating the broad acres
spreading from its base.</p>
<p>The construction camp rested on one of the hillsides
above the dam. And here one summer afternoon a man
stepped forth from the long low tar-papered shack that
served as headquarters, directing his gaze down the road
across the mesa at a departing automobile. He was
Steele Weir, the new chief, a tall, strong, tanned man of
thirty-five, with lean smooth-shaven face, a straight
heavy nose, mouth that by habit was set in grim lines,
and heavy brows under which ruled cold, level, insistent,
gray eyes. He had come suddenly, unexpectedly, returning
with Magney, the engineer in charge, when the
latter had been summoned east for a conference with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12' name='page_12'></a>12</span>
the company&rsquo;s directors. He had replaced Magney,
who was now whirling away to the nearest railway
point, Bowenville, thirty-five miles distant.</p>
<p>He thoughtfully watched the car, a black spot in a
haze of dust, speeding towards the New Mexican town
of San Mateo, on the Burntwood River two miles below
camp, its cluster of brown adobe houses showing indistinctly
through the cottonwoods that embowered the
place. For Magney he felt a certain amount of sympathy,
for the engineer was leaving with a recognition
of defeat; he was a likeable man, as Steele Weir had
discovered during their brief acquaintance, a good theoretical
engineer, but lacking in the prime quality of a
successful chief&ndash;&ndash;fighting spirit and an indomitable will.</p>
<p>Under Magney the work of construction had been inaugurated
the previous summer, but progress had not
been as rapid as desired; there had been delays, labor
difficulties, local opposition during the months since;
and Weir had been chosen to succeed Magney. In his
profession Weir had a reputation, built on relentless toil
and sound ideas and daring achievements&ndash;&ndash;a reputation
enhanced by a character of mystery, for the man was
unmarried, reserved, without intimates or even friends,
locking his lips about his life, and welcoming and executing
with grim indifference to risk engineering commissions
of extreme hazard, on which account he had acquired
the soubriquet of &ldquo;Cold Steel&rdquo; Weir.</p>
<p>Who first bestowed upon Weir that name is not
known. But it was not misapplied. Cold steel he had
proved himself to be a score of times in critical moments
when other men would have broken: in pushing bridges
over mountain chasms, in mine disasters, in strikes, in
almost hopeless fights against bandits in Mexico. And
it was this ability to handle difficulties that had brought
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13' name='page_13'></a>13</span>
about the decision of the directors of the company to
put him in charge, as the man best qualified, at San
Mateo, where the situation was unsatisfactory, costly,
baffling.</p>
<p>Since his arrival a week before he had been consulting
with Magney, studying maps and blue-prints, examining
the work and analyzing general conditions. What
had been accomplished had been well done; he had no
criticism to offer on that score. It was the delay; the
work was considerably behind schedule, which of course
meant excessive cost; and this had undermined the spirit
of the enterprise. In a dozen places, in a dozen ways,
Magney, his predecessor, had been hampered, checked,
defeated&ndash;&ndash;and the main contributing cause was poor
workmen, inefficient work. On that sore Weir&rsquo;s skillful
finger fell at once.</p>
<p>Standing there before the low office building he
watched Magney depart. He, Steele Weir, had now
taken over full charge of the camp and assumed full responsibility
for the project&rsquo;s failure or success. His eye
passed beyond the distant automobile to the town of
San Mateo&ndash;&ndash;a new town for him, but a town like many
he had seen in the southwest and in Mexico. And aside
from its connection with the construction work, it held
a fascinating interest, a profound interest for the man,
the interest that any spot would which has at a distance
cast a black and sinister shadow over one&rsquo;s life. San
Mateo&ndash;&ndash;the name lay like a smoldering coal in his
breast!</p>
<p>At length he turned and strode down the hillside to
the dam site in the canyon. The time had come to shut
his hand about the work and let his hold be felt. He located
the superintendent directing the pouring of concrete
in the frames of the dam core, Atkinson, a man
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14' name='page_14'></a>14</span>
of fifty with a stubby gray mustache, a wind-bitten face
and a tall angular frame. When Weir joined him he
was observing with speculative eyes the indolent movements
of a group of Mexican laborers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those <i>hombres</i> don&rsquo;t appear to be breaking any
speed records, I see,&rdquo; Weir remarked, quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humph,&rdquo; Atkinson grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do they think this is? A rest cure?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The superintendent&rsquo;s silence suddenly gave way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to land on &rsquo;em with an ax-handle and put
the fear of God in their lazy souls,&rdquo; he exclaimed, bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Say, am I hearing right?&rdquo; Atkinson swung fully
about to stare at the new chief. Then he went on,
&ldquo;They&rsquo;d quit to a man if made to do a man&rsquo;s work; I
supposed that Magney had told you that. A dozen
times I&rsquo;ve been ready to throw up my job from self-respect;
I&rsquo;m ashamed to boss work where men can loaf
and I must keep my tongue between my teeth. I was
considering just now the matter of leaving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need, Atkinson. From this time these men will
work or get their dismissal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other pushed his hat atilt and rubbed his head
in surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What about that &lsquo;company policy&rsquo; of hiring nothing
but local labor to keep the community friendly which
Magney was always kicking about?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;That
was what made him sorer than anything else, and beat
him. He said the directors had tied his hands by promising
that no workmen should be imported. If they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15' name='page_15'></a>15</span>
promised that, they sure bunkoed themselves. Friendly,
huh.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people haven&rsquo;t been friendly, eh?&rdquo; Weir said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does it look like it when these Mexicans won&rsquo;t work
enough to earn their salt? They openly boast that we
dare neither make them work nor fire them. They say
Sorenson and his bunch will pull every man off the works
if we lift a finger; and they all know about that fool
promise of the directors. Friendly? Just about as
friendly as a bunch of wildcats. This whole section,
white men and Mexicans, are putting a knife into this
project whenever they can. Do you think they want
all that mesa fenced up and farmed? This is a range
country; they propose to keep it range; they don&rsquo;t want
any more people coming here&ndash;&ndash;farmers, store-keepers,
and white people generally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s always the case in a range country before it&rsquo;s
opened up,&rdquo; Weir said. &ldquo;But they have to swallow the
pill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me tell you something; they don&rsquo;t intend to
swallow it here. They figure on keeping this county
just as it is, for only themselves and their cattle and
woolies, and everybody else keep out. The few big
sheep and cattle men, white and Mex, have their minds
made up to that, and they&rsquo;re the only ones who count;
all the rest are poor Mexicans with nothing but fleas,
children, goats and votes to keep Sorenson and his gang
in control. They&rsquo;ve set out to bust this company, or
tire it out till it throws up the sponge. They&rsquo;ve spiked
Magney, and they&rsquo;ll try to spike you next, and every
manager who comes. That&rsquo;s plain talk I&rsquo;m giving you,
Mr. Weir, but it&rsquo;s fact; and if it doesn&rsquo;t sound nice to
your ears, you can have my resignation any minute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been hoping to hear it. From now on drive this
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16' name='page_16'></a>16</span>
crowd of coffee-colored loafers. Put the lash on their
backs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A gleam of unholy joy shone in Atkinson&rsquo;s eyes as
he heard Weir&rsquo;s words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; that goes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;m warning
you that they&rsquo;ll quit. You&rsquo;ll see &rsquo;em stringing out of
camp for home to-night, and those who hang out till
to-morrow will leave then for sure. By to-morrow night
the dam will be as quiet as a church week-days. They&rsquo;ll
not show up again, either, until you send word for them
to come back&ndash;&ndash;and then they&rsquo;ll know you&rsquo;ve surrendered.
Magney tried it once, just once. And that&rsquo;s
why you found me chewing tobacco so lamb-like and
saying nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn your gat loose,&rdquo; Weir said. And turning on
his heel, he went back to headquarters.</p>
<p>Before Atkinson fired a volley at the unsuspecting
workmen he crossed the canyon to where a cub engineer
was peering through a transit. The superintendent
had overheard a scrap of gossip among the staff one
evening before Weir&rsquo;s arrival when they were discussing
the advent of the new chief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was that name you fellows were saying Weir
was called by?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>The boy straightened up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cold Steel&rsquo;&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;Cold Steel&rsquo; Weir. Anyway that&rsquo;s
what Fergueson says,&rdquo; was the answer. &ldquo;I never heard
it before myself. His first name&rsquo;s Steele, you know, and
he looks cold enough to be ice when he&rsquo;s asking questions
about things, boring into a fellow with his eyes.
But he&rsquo;s up against a hard game here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe. But a man doesn&rsquo;t get a name like that
for just parting his hair nice,&rdquo; Atkinson remarked.
&ldquo;He told me to stretch &rsquo;em&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;a horny thumb jerked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17' name='page_17'></a>17</span>
towards the workmen&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll see some real work
hereabouts for the rest of the afternoon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to-morrow will be Sunday three days ahead of
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know as much about that as I do. Make your
own guess.&rdquo; With which the speaker started off.</p>
<p>The morrow was &ldquo;Sunday&rdquo; with a vengeance. The
majority of the laborers demanded their pay checks the
minute work ceased at the end of the afternoon; Atkinson
tightened orders, and by noon next day the last of
the Mexicans had quit. The fires in the stationary engines
were banked; the concrete mixers did not revolve;
the conveyers were still; the dam site wore an air of
abandonment. In headquarters the engineers worked
over tracings or notes; and in the commissary store the
half-dozen white foremen gathered to smoke and yarn.
That was the extent of the activity.</p>
<p>Two days passed. After dinner Weir held a terse
long-distance telephone conversation, the only incident
of the second day; and it was overheard by no one. On
the fourth day this was repeated. At dawn of the fifth
he despatched all of the foremen, enginemen and engineers
with wagons to Bowenville; and about the middle
of the afternoon, accompanied by his assistant, Meyers,
and Atkinson, he sped in the manager&rsquo;s car down the
river for San Mateo, two miles below the camp.</p>
<p>Of the town Steele Weir had had but a glimpse as he
flashed through on his way to the dam the morning of
his arrival twelve days earlier. It had but a single
main street, from which littered side streets and alleys
ran off between mud walls of houses. The county court
house sat among cottonwood trees in an open space. A
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18' name='page_18'></a>18</span>
few pretentious dwellings, homes of white men and the
well-to-do Mexicans, arose among long low adobe structures
that were as brown and characterless as the sun-dried
bricks of which they were built. That was San
Mateo.</p>
<p>Before doors and everywhere along the street workmen
from the dam were idling. As Meyers brought the
automobile to a stop before the court house, news of
Weir&rsquo;s visit spread miraculously and Mexicans began to
saunter forward to hear the engineer&rsquo;s words of surrender,
couched in the form of a suave invitation to return
to work. While the crowd gathered the three
Americans sat quietly in the car. Then Steele Weir
stood up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who can speak for these men?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>A lean Mexican with a long shiny black mustache
and a thin neck protruding from a soiled linen collar
elbowed a way to the front.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m authorized to speak for them,&rdquo; he announced,
disclosing his white teeth in an engaging smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you one of the workmen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;m a lawyer and represent them in this controversy.
By your favor therefore let us proceed.
You&rsquo;ve come to persuade them to resume work, and that
is well. But there are conditions to be agreed upon
before they return, which with your permission I shall
state&ndash;&ndash;first, no harsh driving of the workmen by foremen;
second, full wages for the days they have been
idle; third, no Sunday work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer regarded the speaker without change of
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you finished?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. There are minor matters, but they can be
adjusted later. These are the important points.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19' name='page_19'></a>19</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, this is my reply: I, not the workmen,
make the terms for work on this job&ndash;&ndash;I, not these men,
name the conditions on which they may return. And
they are as follows: no pay for the idle days; if the
workmen return they agree to work as ordered by superintendent
and foremen; and last, they must start
for the dam within an hour or not at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Incredulity, amazement rested on the Mexican spokesman&rsquo;s
face as he listened to this curt rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Preposterous, impossible, absurd!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
Then revolving on his heels so as to face the crowd he
swiftly repeated in Spanish what Weir had said.</p>
<p>An angry stir followed, murmurs, sullen looks, a number
of oaths and jeers. The lawyer turned again to the
engineer, spreading his hands in a wide gesture and lifting
his brows with exaggerated significance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, Mr. Weir, your position is hopeless,&rdquo; he
remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask them if they definitely refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer put the question to the crowd. A chorus
of shouts vehemently gave affirmation&ndash;&ndash;a refusal immediate,
disdainful, unanimous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll now discuss the men&rsquo;s terms,&rdquo; the lawyer remarked
politely and with an air of satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing more to discuss. The matter is
settled. They have refused; they need not seek work
at the dam again. Start the car, Meyers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The roar of the machine drowned the indignant lawyer&rsquo;s
protest, the crowd hastened to give an opening
and the conference was at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drive to Vorse&rsquo;s saloon; I want a look at Vorse,&rdquo;
said Weir. &ldquo;I see the place a short way ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they entered the long low adobe building an
anemic-appearing Mexican standing at the far end of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20' name='page_20'></a>20</span>
the bar languidly started forward to serve them, but a
bald-headed, hawk-nosed man seated at a desk behind
the cigar-case laid aside his newspaper, arose and
checked the other by a sidewise jerk of his head.</p>
<p>He received their orders for beer and lifted three dripping
bottles from a tub of water at his feet. His eyes
passed casually over Steele Weir&rsquo;s face, glanced away,
then came back for a swift unblinking scrutiny. The
eyes his own met were as hard, stony and inscrutable
as his own. Finally Vorse, the saloon-keeper, turned
his gaze towards the window and extracting a quill
tooth-pick from a vest pocket began thoughtfully to
pick his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the new manager at the dam?&rdquo; he asked
presently, still considering the street through the window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And your name is Weir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got it right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The questions ended there. The three men from camp
slowly consumed their beer and exchanged indifferent
remarks. At the end of five minutes the Mexican lawyer,
clutching the arm of an elderly, gray-mustached man,
entered the saloon.</p>
<p>They lined up at the bar nearby the others. The older
of the pair regarded the trio shrewdly, laid a calf-bound
book that he carried under his arm upon the counter
and ordered &ldquo;a little bourbon.&rdquo; When he had swallowed
this, he addressed the men from the engineering
camp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which of you is Mr. Weir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am he,&rdquo; Steele replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Martinez here has solicited me, Mr. Weir, to use
my offices in explaining to you the workmen&rsquo;s point of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21' name='page_21'></a>21</span>
view in the controversy that exists relative to the work.
I&rsquo;m Senator Gordon, a member of the state legislature,
and I have no interest in the matter beyond seeing an
amicable and just arrangement effected.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele Weir fixed his eyes on the speaker with an intentness,
a cold penetration, that seemed to bore to the
very recesses of his mind. In that look there was something
questioning and something menacing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no controversy and hence no need of your
services. The men stopped work, refused to return, and
now the case is closed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear sir, let us talk it over,&rdquo; said the Senator,
bringing forth a pair of spectacles and setting the bow
upon his nose.</p>
<p>The engineer&rsquo;s visage failed to relax at this pacific
proposal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I gave them their chance and they declined; they&rsquo;ll
have no other,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Those men have browbeaten
the company long enough. They refused, and as I anticipated
that refusal I made preparations accordingly;
a hundred and fifty white workmen arrived at Bowenville
from Denver this morning and a hundred and fifty more
will come to-morrow. They will do the work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Senator&rsquo;s lips quivered and the upper one lifted
in a movement like a snarl, showing tobacco-stained
teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter isn&rsquo;t closed, understand that,&rdquo; he
snapped out. &ldquo;We have the directors&rsquo; promise no outside
labor shall be brought in here for this job, and the
promise shall be kept.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The new men go to work in the morning,&rdquo; Weir said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll repent of this action, young man, you&rsquo;ll repent
of it.&rdquo; The Senator seized the whisky bottle and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22' name='page_22'></a>22</span>
angrily poured himself a second drink. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll repent
of it as sure as your name is&ndash;&ndash;is&ndash;&ndash;whatever it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer took a step nearer the older man. His
face now was as hard as granite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weir is my name,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Did you ever hear it
before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weir&ndash;&ndash;Weir?&rdquo; came in a questioning mutter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker&rsquo;s eyes held the Senator&rsquo;s in savage leash,
and a slight tremble presently began to shake the old
man. Atkinson and Meyers and even the volatile Mexican
lawyer, Martinez, remained unstirring, for in the
situation they suddenly sensed something beyond their
ken, some current of deep unknown forces, some play of
fierce, obscure and fateful passion.</p>
<p>A shadow of gray stole over Gordon&rsquo;s lineaments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are&ndash;&ndash;are the son of&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; came gasping forth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am. His son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I know what happened thirty years ago in this
selfsame room!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whisky that the Senator had poured into his
glass suddenly slopped over his fingers; his figure all
at once appeared more aged, hollow, bent. Without
further word, with his hand still shaking, he set the
glass on the bar, mechanically picked up the law book
and walked feebly towards the door.</p>
<p>Steele Weir turned his gaze on the saloon-keeper,
Vorse. The man&rsquo;s right hand was under the bar and
he seemed to be awaiting the engineer&rsquo;s next move, taut,
tight-lipped, malignant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was for you too, Vorse,&rdquo; was flung at him.
&ldquo;One Weir went out of here, but another has returned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he led his companions away.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h3>A COMEDY&ndash;&ndash;AND SOMETHING ELSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Towards noon one day a week later Steele Weir,
headed for Bowenville in his car, had gained Chico
Creek, half way between camp and San Mateo, when he
perceived that another machine blocked the ford. About
the wheels of the stalled car the shallow water rippled
briskly, four or five inches deep; entirely deep enough,
by all appearances, to keep marooned in the runabout
the girl sitting disconsolately at the wheel.</p>
<p>She was a very attractive-looking girl, Steele noted
casually as he brought his own car to a halt and sprang
out to join her, wading the water with his laced boots.
As he approached he perceived that she had a slender
well-rounded figure, fine-spun brown hair under her
hat brim, clear brown eyes and the pink of peach blossoms
in her soft smooth cheeks.</p>
<p>But her look of relief vanished when she distinguished
his face and her shoulders squared themselves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has your engine stopped?&rdquo; he inquired.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll look into the hood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I prefer that you would not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant surprise marked his countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that you desire to remain here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wish to remain here, but I choose that in
preference to your aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, who had bent forward to lift one cover of
the engine, straightened up at that. He considered her
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24' name='page_24'></a>24</span>
intently and in silence for a time, marking her heightened
color, the haughty poise of her head, the firm set
of her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my knowledge, I never saw you before in my life,&rdquo;
he remarked at last. &ldquo;What, may I ask, is your particular
reason for declining my services?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She was dumb for a little, while she tucked back a
stray tendril of hair. The act was performed with the
left hand; and Weir&rsquo;s eyes, which seldom missed anything,
observed a diamond flash on the third finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;d choose not to explain,&rdquo; said she, afterwards,
&ldquo;but if you insist&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t insist, I merely request ... your highness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A flash of anger shot from her eyes at this irony.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m afraid to tell you!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
because you&rsquo;re the manager of the construction camp;
and if you&rsquo;ve never seen me before, I&rsquo;ve at least had you
pointed out to me. I wish no assistance from the man
who turns off his poor workmen without excuse or warning,
and brings want and trouble upon the community.
It was like striking them in the face. And then you
break your promise not to bring in other workmen!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As she had said, she did not lack courage. Her words
gushed forth in a torrent, as if an expression of pent
up and outraged justice, disclosing a fervent sympathy
and a fine zeal&ndash;&ndash;and, likewise, a fine ignorance of the
facts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you say something?&rdquo; she added,
when he gave no indication of replying.</p>
<p>Steele could have smiled at this feminine view of the
matter that violent assertions required affirmations or
denials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What am I supposed to say?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Apparently that exhausted her patience.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25' name='page_25'></a>25</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll please molest me no longer,&rdquo; she stated, icily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He raised the hood and inspected the engine. During
his attempts to start it, she sat nonchalantly humming
an air and gazing at the mountains as if her mind were a
thousand miles away&ndash;&ndash;which it was not.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something wrong; it will have to be hauled in,&rdquo; said
he finally.</p>
<p>No reply. Steele returned to his own car and descending
into the creek bed worked his way around her.
When he was on the far bank, he rejoined her again,
carrying a coil of rope. One end of this he fastened
securely to the rear axle of her runabout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, sir?&rdquo; she demanded,
whirling about on her seat and glaring angrily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Drag you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; was his calm response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Against my wishes, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is abominable!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll put on the brakes.&rdquo; And put them on she did,
with a savage jerk.</p>
<p>But nevertheless Weir&rsquo;s powerful machine drew her
car slowly up out of the creek upon the road, where he
forced it about until it pointed towards San Mateo.
Then he retied the rope on the front axle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now for town,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you haul me out of there, I demand to
know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Because you were a public obstruction
blocking traffic. If you had remained there long enough
you would have become a public nuisance; and it&rsquo;s the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26' name='page_26'></a>26</span>
duty of every citizen to abate nuisances. No one would
call you a nuisance, of course,&ndash;&ndash;not to your face, at
any rate. But travelers might have felt some annoyance
if compelled to drive around you; they might even
have had you arrested when they learned you were
acting out of willful stubbornness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In a sort of incredulous wonder, of charmed horror,
the girl heard herself thus unfeelingly described.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you barbarian!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ready? We&rsquo;re off for town now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run my car in the ditch and wreck it if you so
much as pull it another inch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be frustrated in my generous acts;
they are so few, according to common report. Well,
we&rsquo;ll leave the car, but it must be drawn off the road.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When this was accomplished, Weir replaced the rope
in his machine. Then he returned to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What now? Do you intend to sit here in the hot
sunshine, to say nothing of missing your dinner?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That doesn&rsquo;t concern you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir shook his head gravely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be saved from your own folly,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Before she had realized what was happening, he had
opened the door of the runabout, swung her out upon
the ground and was marching her towards his own machine.
Stupefaction at this quick, atrocious deed left
her an automaton; and before she had fully regained
her control they were speeding towards San Mateo, she
at his side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is outrageous!&rdquo; she gasped.</p>
<p>Steele Weir did not speak until they entered town.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is your home?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Turn to the right at the end of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was before a house of modern structure, banked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27' name='page_27'></a>27</span>
with a bewildering number of flowers and shaded by
trees, that he halted the car. He alighted, bared his
head, assisted her to descend, bowed and then without
a word drove away, leaving her to stare after him with
a baffling mixture of feelings and the single indignant
statement, &ldquo;And he didn&rsquo;t even wait long enough for me
to thank him!&rdquo; Nor did her perplexity lessen when her
car was left before the door during the afternoon by one
of the camp mechanics to whom Weir had telephoned
from San Mateo and who had put it in running order.</p>
<p>Weir himself proceeded to Bowenville, where matters
regarding shipments and the unloading of machinery
engaged him the rest of the day. Into his mind, however,
there floated at moments the image of the girl&rsquo;s face,
banish it as he would. He had learned her name by
asking who was the owner of the house where she had
alighted, information necessary to direct the mechanic
as to the delivery of the stalled car. Hosmer it was;
and the residence was that of Dr. Hosmer. Presumably
she was his daughter. And what a vivid, charming,
never-surrender enemy! Lucky the chap who had won
this high-spirited girl.</p>
<p>The memory of her eyes and her personality was still
with him when he ate his supper that evening in a restaurant
in Bowenville. His own past in relation to the
other sex had been starred by no love affair, not even
by episodes of a sentimental nature; the character of
his work had for long periods kept him away from
women&rsquo;s society, but further than this there was the
shadow upon his life, the shadow of mystery that obliged
him to follow a solitary course. He considered himself
unfree to seek friendships or favors among women. By
every demand of honor he was bound to solicit no girl&rsquo;s
trust or affection until that mystery was cleared and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28' name='page_28'></a>28</span>
his father&rsquo;s innocence established. It was for this reason
that he seemed even to himself to grow more hard, more
harsh, more silent and aloof, until at last he had come
to believe that no fair face had the power to arouse
his interest or to quicken his pulse.</p>
<p>But now, this girl he had met at the ford!</p>
<p>Long-stifled emotions struggled in his breast. Sleeping
desires awoke. His spirit swelled like a caged thing
within the shell of years of indurated habit. A strange
restlessness pervaded him. He had a fierce passion
somehow to rip in pieces the gray drab pattern of his
commonplace life.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was this revolt against the fetters of fate
that caused him to welcome the chance for action that
presently was offered. The restaurant was of an ordinary
type, with a lunch counter at one side, a row of
tables down the middle and half a dozen booths along
the wall offering some degree of privacy. In one of
these Steele Weir was smoking a cigar and finishing his
coffee before making his ride back to camp. From the
booth adjoining he had for some time been hearing
scraps of conversation; now all at once the voices rose
in protest and in answering explanation, in perplexed
appeal and earnest assurance.</p>
<p>Weir&rsquo;s own reflections ceased. His head turned and
remained fixed to listen, while the cigar grew cold between
his fingers. For ten minutes or so his attitude of
concentrated harkening to the two voices, a girl&rsquo;s and
a man&rsquo;s, remained unchanged. Little by little he was
piecing out the thread of the confidential dialogue&ndash;&ndash;and
of the little drama being enacted in the booth.</p>
<p>His brows became lowering as he gathered its significance,
his lips drew together in a tight thin line. He
did not move when he heard the man push back his chair
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29' name='page_29'></a>29</span>
to leave the place, nor alter his position until there
came the sound of the door closing at the front of the
restaurant. Then he reached for his hat, stood up and
went lightly around into the other booth, where he
pulled the green calico curtain across the opening.</p>
<p>A girl of about seventeen, of plump clean prettiness,
still sat at the table, which was littered with dishes.
The cheap finery of her hat and dress showed a pathetic
attempt to increase her natural comeliness. At this
minute her face showed amazement and a hint of apprehension.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you coming in here for?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to talk to you for a little while,&rdquo; Weir replied,
seating himself. &ldquo;You will please listen. I&rsquo;ve
overheard enough of your talk to catch its drift; you
came here to be married, but now this man wants to
induce you to go to Los Angeles first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That isn&rsquo;t any of your business,&rdquo; the girl flashed
back, going white and red by turns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m making it mine, however. You live up on
Terry Creek, by what I heard; that&rsquo;s not far from my
camp. I&rsquo;m manager at the dam and my name&rsquo;s Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this statement the girl shrank back, beginning to
bite the hem of her handkerchief nervously and gazing
at him with terrified eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m here to help you, not harm you. You&rsquo;ve run
away from home to-day to marry this fellow. Did he
promise to marry you if you came to Bowenville?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now he wants you to go with him to Los
Angeles first, promising to marry you there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl hesitated, with a wavering look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He gives you excuses, of course. But they don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30' name='page_30'></a>30</span>
satisfy your mind, do they? They don&rsquo;t satisfy mine,
at any rate. It&rsquo;s the old trick. Suppose when you
reached the coast he didn&rsquo;t marry you after all and put
you off with more promises and after a week or two
abandoned you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rdquo; she cried, with a gulp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just what he is planning. He didn&rsquo;t meet
you here until after dark, I judge. You&rsquo;ll both go to
the train separately&ndash;&ndash;I overheard that part. Afterwards
he could return from the coast and deny that
he had ever had anything to do with you, and it would
simply be your word against his. And which would
people hereabouts believe, tell me that, which would
they believe, yours or his, after you had gone wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl sat frozen. Then suddenly she began to cry,
softly and with jerks of her shoulders. Weir reached
out and patted her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary&ndash;&ndash;Mary Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, I&rsquo;m interfering in your affairs only because
I know what men will do. You must take no chances.
If this fellow is really anxious to marry you, he&rsquo;ll do
it here in Bowenville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>After a few sobs she wiped her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He said he didn&rsquo;t dare get the license in San Mateo,
or his folks would have stopped our marriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you should stay here to-night, go to the next
county seat and be married to-morrow. His parents are
bound to learn about it once you&rsquo;re married. A few days
more or less make no difference. And though I should
return to my work, I&rsquo;ll just stay over a day and take
you in my car to-morrow to see that you&rsquo;re married
straight and proper. Why go clear to Los Angeles?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31' name='page_31'></a>31</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He said it would be our honeymoon&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;and I
had never been away from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She hesitated in uncertainty whether or not she
should answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed Sorenson,&rdquo; came at last from her lips.</p>
<p>Steele Weir slowly thrust his head forward, fixing
her with burning eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son of the big cattleman?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you love him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, oh, yes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir sat back in his seat, lighted a cigarette and
stared past her head at the opposite partition. The
evil strain of the father had been continued in the son
and was working here to seduce this simple, ignorant
girl, incited by her physical freshness and the expectation
that she should be easy prey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I doubt if he loves you,&rdquo; he said, presently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does, he does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he really does above everything else in the world,
he&rsquo;ll be willing to marry you openly, no matter what
his father may say or do. That&rsquo;s the test, Mary. If
he&rsquo;s in earnest, he&rsquo;ll agree at once to go with us to the
next county seat to-morrow and be married there by a
minister. Isn&rsquo;t that true? Answer me that squarely;
isn&rsquo;t it true?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then by that we&rsquo;ll decide. If he agrees, well and
good; if he refuses, that will show him up&ndash;&ndash;show he
never had any intention of marrying you. I&rsquo;m a
stranger to you, but I&rsquo;m your friend. And you&rsquo;re not
going to Los Angeles unmarried!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32' name='page_32'></a>32</span></div>
<p>The last words were uttered in a level menacing tone
that caused Mary Johnson to shiver. To her, reared
in the humble adobe house on her father&rsquo;s little ranch
on Terry Creek, a man who could manage the great
irrigation project seemed a figure out of her ken, a vast
form working against the sky. His statements were not
to be disputed, whatever she might think.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she said, just above a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Now we&rsquo;ll wait for him. He was coming
back for you, wasn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was to stay at the hotel till train time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this your grip?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir jerked a thumb towards a worn canvas &ldquo;telescope&rdquo;
fastened with a single shawl strap, resting in
the corner of the booth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s mine. Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old is Ed Sorenson,&rdquo; he asked, after a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About thirty, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How old are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seventeen next month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But sixteen yet this month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He said nothing more. As the minutes passed, her
timorous gaze continued steadfastly on the stern countenance
before her. She dully expected something terrible
to happen when Ed Sorenson appeared, for she
knew Ed would be angry; but she had been powerless to
prevent the intrusion of this terrible stranger.</p>
<p>Fear, in truth, a fear that left her heart cold, was
her feeling as she contemplated Weir. Yet under that,
was there not something else? A sense of safety, of
comforting assurance of protection?</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you won&rsquo;t hurt Ed if he won&rsquo;t go with us?&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33' name='page_33'></a>33</span>
she asked, in a low voice. &ldquo;If he gets mad and won&rsquo;t
marry me here, I mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s eyes came round to hers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just break him in two, nothing more, Mary,&rdquo; was
the calm answer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h3>THE ENEMY&rsquo;S SPAWN</h3>
</div>
<p>The curtain to the booth was flung back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve the train tickets; come along to the hotel&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;
exclaimed the man who quickly entered. But the words
died in his mouth at sight of Weir sitting in the place
he had vacated.</p>
<p>He was over average height, of strong fleshy build,
with a small blonde mustache on his upper lip. Under
his eyes little pouches had already begun to form; his
mouth was full and sensual; but he still retained an air
of liveliness, of carelessness and agility, that might at
first sight seem the spontaneity of youth. He wore a
brown suit, a gray flannel shirt and Stetson hat&ndash;&ndash;the
common apparel of the country.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the devil are you? And what are you butting
in here for?&rdquo; he exclaimed, with a vicious spark showing
in his pale blue eyes. At the same time he clapped
a hand on Weir&rsquo;s shoulder, closing it in a hard grasp.</p>
<p>Instantly Weir struck the hand off with his fist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your dirty flippers to yourself,&rdquo; he said, rising.</p>
<p>The blood faded from the other&rsquo;s countenance, leaving
it white with rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out of this booth, or I&rsquo;ll throw you out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Weir&rsquo;s turn to act. Like a flash he caught
Sorenson&rsquo;s elbow, jerked him forward, spun him about
and dropped him upon the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there, you cradle-robber, until I&rsquo;m through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35' name='page_35'></a>35</span>
with you,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;And if you don&rsquo;t want
everybody in this restaurant to know about your business
with this girl, you&rsquo;ll lower your voice when you
talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson shot an uneasy glance towards the curtain
and his wrath became not less furious but better controlled.
Clearly public attention was the last thing
he desired in this affair. He leaned back, staring at
Steele Weir insolently, and produced a cigarette, at
which he began to puff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary, get ready. We&rsquo;ll be going in a minute,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;ll not, Sorenson. I&rsquo;ve taken a hand in your
game. This girl says you&rsquo;re going to marry her, is that
right?&rdquo; The other rolled his eyes upward and began
to whistle a jig tune softly. &ldquo;Well, this is the plan she
and I&rsquo;ve made. She&rsquo;ll remain at the hotel to-night&ndash;&ndash;as
will you and I&ndash;&ndash;and to-morrow we&rsquo;ll drive to another
county seat in my car and you&rsquo;ll secure a licence there.
Then you&rsquo;ll go to a minister&rsquo;s, where I&rsquo;ll act as a witness,
and the ceremony will be performed. Afterwards
the pair of you can proceed to Los Angeles, or elsewhere
as you please, on your wedding journey.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re quite a little planner, aren&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; the other
jeered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the arrangement if you agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t agree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary Johnson, in whose eyes a light of hope had
dawned during Weir&rsquo;s low-toned statement, began nervously
to bite her lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t you do it, Ed?&rdquo; she asked, timidly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll do as I planned, or nothing,&rdquo; he stated. Then
with sudden spite he continued, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re responsible for
this mixup. What did you let this fellow in here for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36' name='page_36'></a>36</span>
while I was gone? Didn&rsquo;t you have sense enough to
keep your mouth shut?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele halted him by a gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t begin abusing her; you&rsquo;re not married to her
yet. I overheard your talk and guessed the low-lived,
scoundrelly trick you proposed to play on her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You damned eavesdropper&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure, eavesdropper is right,&rdquo; Weir interrupted,
coolly. &ldquo;So I just stepped in here from my booth next
door to discuss the situation with her; you can&rsquo;t mislead
an innocent girl like her with the intention of shaking
her when you get her into a city, not if I know about
it and am around. If you sincerely intend to marry
her, and will do so to-morrow in my presence, then I&rsquo;ll
withdraw. Afterwards I mean, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Mary. Stand aside, you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t go with you,&rdquo; the engineer stated.</p>
<p>For a moment the men&rsquo;s eyes locked, those of one
full of blue fire and hatred, those of the other quiet
as pieces of flint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And she shall keep with me while I telephone to your
father that you brought her here under promise of
marriage, a girl of sixteen, without her own parents&rsquo;
consent, and now refuse to marry her,&rdquo; Steele added.</p>
<p>A sneer twisted the other man&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father happens to be in the east, where he&rsquo;s been
for a month,&rdquo; he mocked. &ldquo;If he were here, he wouldn&rsquo;t
believe you; he&rsquo;d know you were a liar. He knows I&rsquo;m
engaged to marry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Bite off the words as he tried,
they had escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, that&rsquo;s the way of it!&rdquo; Weir remarked with a
silky smoothness. &ldquo;You expect to marry some other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37' name='page_37'></a>37</span>
girl&ndash;&ndash;and have no intention whatever of marrying Mary
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To hell with you and your opinions!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, you coax her to Bowenville by a promise, then
you persuade her by more promises to go to Los Angeles,&rdquo;
the engineer proceeded steadily, &ldquo;and there you
would betray and abandon her to a life on the streets,
like the yellow cur you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson snapped his fingers and moved round to the
girl&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pay no attention to him,&rdquo; he addressed her. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s
only a crazy fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But she drew back against the wall, staring at him
with a strained, searching regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you marry me to-morrow as he asks?&rdquo; she
questioned anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I explained the reason why once. Come on;
let&rsquo;s get away from him. Then I&rsquo;ll make everything
clear and satisfactory to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For a moment she stood wavering, picking at her
handkerchief, her face pale and unhappy, questioning
his countenance. Finally she turned to look at Steele
Weir, standing silently by.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You never said you were engaged to another girl;
you told me I was the only one you loved,&rdquo; she muttered
in a choked voice. &ldquo;But I see now you won&rsquo;t marry me.
You wish me to go with you&ndash;&ndash;but not to marry. I&rsquo;m
going away&ndash;&ndash;away anywhere. By myself! Where I&rsquo;ll
never see any one!&rdquo; Burying her face in her hands, she
shook with sobs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is what comes from your putting an oar in,&rdquo;
said Sorenson, lifting his fist in a burst of fury to strike
Weir.</p>
<p>The latter at once smote him across the mouth with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38' name='page_38'></a>38</span>
open palm at the vile epithet that followed. Sorenson
staggered, then lunged forward, tugging at something
in his hip-pocket, while the table and dishes went over
in a crash.</p>
<p>Before he could draw the weapon Steele&rsquo;s fingers shot
forth and seized his wrist; his other hand closed about
Sorenson&rsquo;s throat in an iron grasp. Slowly under that
powerful grip the younger man&rsquo;s struggles ceased, his
eyes dilated, his knees yielded and gave way. The revolver
was wrenched from his numbed hold. His eyeballs
seemed afire; his breast heaved in violent spasms
for the denied breath; and his heart appeared about to
burst.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You miserable skunk!&rdquo; Weir said, barely moving
his mouth. &ldquo;I ought to choke the life out of you.&rdquo;
Then he released his hold. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep this gun&ndash;&ndash;and
use it if you ever try to pull another on me! Now,
make tracks. Remember, too, to pay your bill as you
go out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Sorenson had straightened his coat, giving
Weir a malignant look during the process, he departed.
His air of disdainful insolence had quite evaporated, but
that he considered the action between them only begun
was plain, though he spoke not a word. Weir, however,
heard him give a quieting explanation to the waiter hovering
outside, who had been drawn by the crash of
dishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thought a fight was going on,&rdquo; the aproned dispenser
of food said to Steele when he and the girl
emerged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just an accident. Nothing broken, I imagine,&rdquo; was
the response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t break those dishes with a hammer;
they&rsquo;re made for rough work.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39' name='page_39'></a>39</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;If there&rsquo;s any damage, this may cover it.&rdquo; And
Steele tossed the fellow a dollar.</p>
<p>Outside the restaurant he slipped his hand inside
Mary Johnson&rsquo;s arm and led her along the street. With
him he had brought the old strapped grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you taking me?&rdquo; she asked, in a worried
quaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Home, Mary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;m afraid to go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you afraid of your own father and mother?
They&rsquo;re the ones to trust first of all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But when father&ndash;&ndash;mother is dead&ndash;&ndash;sees the telescope,
he&rsquo;ll want to know where I&rsquo;ve been. He doesn&rsquo;t
know I have it. I told him I might stay with a girl at
San Mateo over night, and then sneaked it out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The best thing is to tell him all about this occurrence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I shall. Leave that part to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And though her heart was filled with fresh alarms
and fears at the prospect, there seemed nothing else to
do. She longed to flee, to hide in some dark hole, to
cover her shame from her father and the world, but in
the hands of this determined man she felt herself powerless.
What he willed, she dumbly did.</p>
<p>Terry Creek flowed out of the mountains four miles
north of San Mateo, an insignificant stream entering the
Burntwood halfway down to Bowenville. The Johnson
ranch house was a mile up the canyon, where the rocky
walls expanded into a grassy park of no great area.
They reached the girl&rsquo;s home about half-past nine that
night.</p>
<p>For two hours Weir remained talking with the father,
describing the affair at Bowenville, fending off his first
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40' name='page_40'></a>40</span>
bitter anger at the girl and gradually persuading him
to see that Mary had been deceived, lured away on hollow
promises and was guiltless of all except failing to
take him into her confidence. At last peace was made.
Mary wept for a time, and was patted on the head by
her rough, bearded father, who exclaimed, &ldquo;There,
there, don&rsquo;t cry. You&rsquo;re safe back again; we&rsquo;ll just
forget it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside of the house, however, where he had accompanied
Weir to his car, he said with an oath:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll not forget Ed Sorenson, if I go to hell for
it. My little girl!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s half a child yet, that&rsquo;s the worse of his offense,&rdquo;
Steele replied, savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary said you choked him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some. Not enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget him&ndash;&ndash;or you, Mr. Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele mounted into his machine. He thoughtfully
studied the rancher&rsquo;s bearded, weather-tanned face, illuminated
by the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At present I&rsquo;d say nothing about this matter to
any one. Later on you may be able to use it in squaring
accounts,&rdquo; the engineer advised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; was the answer, with a bitter note. &ldquo;But
talking would only hurt Mary, not Ed Sorenson. Whatever
the Sorensons do is all right, you know, because
they&rsquo;re rich. The daughter of a poor man like me
would get all the black end of the gossip; and I can&rsquo;t
lift a finger, that&rsquo;s what grinds me, unless I go out and
shoot him, then hang for it. For the bank&rsquo;s got a
mortgage on my little bunch of stock, and on my ranch
here, and Sorenson, of course, is the bank. Gordon and
Vorse and a few others are in it too, but he&rsquo;s the bull
of the herd. If I opened my mouth about his son, I&rsquo;d
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41' name='page_41'></a>41</span>
be kicked off of Terry Creek, lock, stock and barrel.
That&rsquo;s the way Sorenson keeps all of us poor devils,
white and Mexican, eating out of his hand. I&rsquo;ve just
been poor since I came here a boy; the gang in San
Mateo won&rsquo;t let anybody but themselves have a chance.
And I reckon old man Sorenson wouldn&rsquo;t care much if
his boy had ruined my girl. Cuss him a little, maybe;
that would be all. But I won&rsquo;t forget the whelp. Some
day my chance will come to play even.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Sure; if one just keeps quiet and waits,&rdquo; Steele
agreed. &ldquo;Well, I must hit the trail. If you want work
any time, come over to the dam; we can always use a
man with a team.&rdquo;
Johnson nodded.
&ldquo;After haying is done, maybe. And remember, I&rsquo;m
much obliged to you for looking after my little girl. I
won&rsquo;t forget that, either.&rdquo;
He reached up diffidently and shook hands with the
engineer. Weir&rsquo;s grip was sympathetic and sincere.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h3>A SECRET CONFERENCE</h3>
</div>
<p>On a certain afternoon Felipe Martinez, the lean and
restless attorney who had acted as the Mexican workmen&rsquo;s
mouthpiece, observed through the broad plate-glass
window of the San Mateo Cattle Company&rsquo;s office
an incident that greatly interested him. For the moment
he forgot the resentment kindled by Sorenson&rsquo;s
abrupt refusal and brutal words when he asked for the
nomination for county attorney. The election was in
the autumn; the nomination was equivalent to election;
and Felipe considered that he had too long been kept
apart from that particular spoil.</p>
<p>Martinez had once had a slight difference with the
banker, and now outrageously Sorenson had recalled it.
He had stated that Martinez should hold no political
office; he gave offices only to men who did exactly as he
advised; his exact words were that the Mexican was
&ldquo;tricky and no good.&rdquo; And picking up his hat Sorenson
who had that day returned home from the east went
out of the bank, leaving Martinez to stare out of the
window and meditatively twist a point of his silky black
mustache.</p>
<p>It was before the window that there occurred the meeting
between Sorenson and the manager of the dam.
Martinez perceived the two men glance at each other
and pass, but after a step or two both men halted. As
if worked by a single wire, they slowly swung about for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43' name='page_43'></a>43</span>
a second look. The Mexican&rsquo;s nimble brain calculated
that they could not have previously met and in consequence
their behavior bespoke something out of the
ordinary.</p>
<p>The pair stood exactly where they had turned, three
or four paces apart, he noted. The Mexican&rsquo;s mind
palpitated with a slight thrill of excitement. The
manner of each of the men was that of a fighting animal
looking over another animal of the same sort:
neither uttering a word, nor stirring a finger, nor yielding
a particle in his fixed unwinking gaze. Martinez
could almost feel the exchanged challenge, the cold antagonism,
the hostile curiosity, the matching of wills,
the instant hate, between the men.</p>
<p>Though they had not met before, to be sure, nevertheless
they were enemies. Was it because of the discharge
of the workmen? Then Martinez&rsquo; mind flashed back to
the scene in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon when Gordon had showed such
sudden emotion at the engineer&rsquo;s name and his enigmatical
reference to some event in the past. That was it!
Something which had occurred thirty years ago, probably
something crooked. Men committed deeds in those
early days that they would now like to forget. He,
Martinez, would look into the matter.</p>
<p>Sorenson passed out of sight, and Weir likewise proceeded
on his way. Thereupon the lawyer sauntered
over to the court house, where presently he became engrossed
in a pile of tomes in the register&rsquo;s office. As examining
records is a part of a lawyer&rsquo;s regular work,
it never excites curiosity or arouses suspicion.</p>
<p>That same evening Martinez perceived Vorse enter
Sorenson&rsquo;s office. Vorse, he recalled, had been included
in the engineer&rsquo;s threatening remarks to Gordon. Shortly
thereafter Gordon himself ambled along the street
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44' name='page_44'></a>44</span>
and passed through the door. Last of all, Burkhardt, a
short, fleshy, bearded man, went into the building. The
vultures of San Mateo, as he secretly called them, had
flocked together for conference. Presently Martinez
strolled by the office, outwardly displaying no interest
in the structure but furtively seeking to catch a glimpse
of the interior through a crack of the drawn shade.
But in this he was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Of one thing he was certain, however. His prolonged
examination of the county records had revealed an old
bill of sale of a ranch and several herds of cattle from
one Joseph Weir to Sorenson, Vorse, Gordon and
Burkhardt. He had placed his finger on the link connecting
the engineer with these men, the entire four, as
this old bill of sale thus recorded showed the intimate
though unexpressed partnership of the men, which was
common knowledge over the country; and intuition told
him also that this private assembly of the quartette
quickly on Sorenson&rsquo;s return home had its inspiration in
the new manager of the dam.</p>
<p>Martinez determined to continue his investigations.
Events might yet prove that it would have been much
better for the cattleman to have given him the political
nomination. Truly, it was possible. In any case, it
would do no harm to have &ldquo;something on&rdquo; Sorenson and
the others, these rulers of San Mateo. And there was
the opposite side of the affair&ndash;&ndash;Weir&rsquo;s side; so it looked
as if there might be profit either way.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>The four men sitting in the railed-off space in the
San Mateo Cattle Company&rsquo;s office constituted the
cattle company. Moreover, they comprised the financial,
political and general power of this remote section
of New Mexico. In face, manner, garb, they were dissimilar.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45' name='page_45'></a>45</span>
Vorse, clothed in gray, was hawk-nosed and impassive;
and though now, like his companions, wealthy
beyond simple needs he nevertheless continued the operation
of his saloon that had been a landmark in San
Mateo for forty years. Burkhardt was rough-featured,
rough-tongued, choleric, and coatless: typically the
burly, uncurried, uncouth stock man, whose commonest
words were oaths or curses and whose way with obstinate
cattle or men was the way of the club or the fist. Gordon
was the wily, cautious, unscrupulous politician; he
had represented San Mateo in the legislature for years,
both during the Territorial period and since New Mexico
had become a state, and was not unknown in other
parts of the southwest; but he was &ldquo;Judge&rdquo; only by
courtesy, the title most frequently given him, never having
been admitted to the bar or having practiced, and
engaged himself ostensibly in the insurance and real
estate business. Like the others, his share of the large
cattle, sheep and land holdings of the group made him
independent. Sorenson, the last of the four and in
reality the leader because of a greater breadth of vision
and a natural capacity for business, was dressed in a
tailored suit of greenish plaid&ndash;&ndash;a man with bushy eyebrows,
a long fleshy nose, predatory eyes, a heavy cat-fish
mouth and a great, barrel-like body that reared two or
three inches over six feet when he stood on his feet. But
one thing they had in common, in addition to the gray
hair of age, and that was a joint liability for the past.
For years they had believed that liability extinguished
through the operation of time. They had considered
as closed and sealed the account of early secret, lawless
acts by which they had acquired wealth and a grip on
the community. They were now law-observing members
of society; they controlled even if they sometimes failed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46' name='page_46'></a>46</span>
to possess the goodwill of the county&ndash;&ndash;and they were
not men to measure position by friendships; their councils
determined how much or how little other men should
own and in local politics their fingers moved the puppets
that served their will.</p>
<p>With the entrance here of the powerful group of financiers
who were constructing the irrigation project they
recognized the threat to their old-time supremacy.
Cattle and sheep interests would succumb to farming;
a swarm of new, independent settlers would arrive like
locusts; and their leadership would eventually be challenged
if not ended. New towns would spring up. New
money would flow in to dispute their financial mastery.
New leaders would arise to assail their political dominion.
And against the prospect of all this they had initiated
a secret warfare, endeavoring by stealth to ruin
the irrigation company at the beginning and nip the
danger in the bud.</p>
<p>Now it had been revealed all at once that they had
not only a general and impersonal enemy in the form
of the company, but a specific one in the form of a man,
its manager. Out of nowhere he had emerged, out of
thirty years&rsquo; silence, a sinister figure who tapped with
significant finger the book of their secret past while his
eyes steadfastly demanded a reckoning. Did he know
all, or nothing? Knowing, did he deliberately leave them
in doubt in order to shatter their confidence?</p>
<p>At least one of the four had been badly shaken on
learning Weir&rsquo;s identity, and all now were uneasy. It
was as if Fate after a long silence was about to open
the sealed record.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps you were just imagining things, Judge,&rdquo;
Sorenson was saying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47' name='page_47'></a>47</span></div>
<p>Senator Gordon moistened his lips and tugged nervously
at his gray mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Just ask Vorse. The man
said his name was Weir and that he was the son of Joe
Weir. Then&ndash;&ndash;then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Sorenson demanded, frowning at the other&rsquo;s
visible trepidation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Weir added, &lsquo;And I know what happened thirty
years ago in this selfsame room.&rsquo; Those were his very
words. Isn&rsquo;t that true, Vorse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They could mean only one thing,&rdquo; said Gordon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Judge went out he said to me,&rdquo; Vorse
stated, &ldquo;&lsquo;That was for you too.&rsquo; I had my hand on my
gun under the counter as he said it, ready if he made
a move. He knew what I had there, but it didn&rsquo;t faze
him. He&rsquo;s a better man than Joe Weir ever was, I want
to remark, and different; he has nerve and a bad eye.
He knows something, lay your bets on that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much? How much? If we only knew how
much!&rdquo; Judge Gordon vouchsafed, testily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How would he know anything? Joe Weir didn&rsquo;t
know, so how can this fellow know? Don&rsquo;t get scared
at a shadow.&rdquo; It was the bearded, rough-tongued Burkhardt
who spoke, concluding his words with a blasphemous
oath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the Mexican who saw what happened&ndash;&ndash;and
that boy who looked in at the back door,&rdquo; Gordon asserted.
&ldquo;We just caught sight of him and couldn&rsquo;t make
out his face against the light. Then he had skipped
when we ran there. We never did learn who he was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think he remembers?&rdquo; Sorenson said, scornfully.
&ldquo;He may be dead. He may be on the other side
of the world. Just some kid who happened to drift by
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48' name='page_48'></a>48</span>
at the minute and look in, and there&rsquo;s not one chance
in a million he&rsquo;s anywhere around these parts yet. He
would have blabbed long ago to some one if he had been;
don&rsquo;t figure him in, he&rsquo;s lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saurez isn&rsquo;t, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this Vorse put in a word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He saw more than one killing in those days when
he was roustabout for me. It was only one more to
him. Probably he has forgotten it. Anyway,&rdquo; Vorse
ended with deadly emphasis, &ldquo;he knows what would
happen to him even now if he remembered it and talked.
Leave him out of the calculation too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then that just makes the four of us,&rdquo; said Burkhardt.
&ldquo;Nobody else. So this fellow Weir doesn&rsquo;t know
a thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can&rsquo;t be absolutely sure,&rdquo; Judge Gordon replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, he&rsquo;d need proof, wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, to bring legal action. But how do we
know he hasn&rsquo;t even that? Look all around the question
as a lawyer does; let us assume the millionth chance,
for instance. Suppose that he somewhere met and became
acquainted with that boy. Suppose that he learned
the latter had been here at the time and saw the shooting;
and heard his story. Suppose that Weir knows
this instant where he is and can produce him as a witness
in court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon in this county his testimony wouldn&rsquo;t count
for much,&rdquo; Burkhardt, who had been sheriff, stated, with
a harsh laugh.</p>
<p>Sorenson, however, was impressed by the Judge&rsquo;s
reasoning, for he drummed with fingers on the desk
and sat in brooding silence. So likewise sat Vorse, who
had heard Weir&rsquo;s utterance and beheld his face.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49' name='page_49'></a>49</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He knows something,&rdquo; he repeated, in a convinced
tone. &ldquo;Or he&rsquo;s a damned good bluffer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I passed him here at the door this afternoon,&rdquo; the
banker remarked. &ldquo;I turned to look at him, guessing
who he was, and he had stopped and was looking at me.
Cool about it too. We&rsquo;ll have to watch him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps if we just tip him off to keep his mouth shut
tight, that will be enough,&rdquo; Burkhardt suggested. &ldquo;If
he knows the four of us are ready&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vorse sniffed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You think he can be bluffed?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t
seen him yet; go take a look. We&rsquo;ll not throw any scare
into him. If he were that kind, he wouldn&rsquo;t have told us
who he is. He wanted us to know he&rsquo;s after us, that&rsquo;s
my opinion. He wants to shake our nerve&ndash;&ndash;and he
shook the Judge&rsquo;s all right that day at my bar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did,&rdquo; Gordon admitted. &ldquo;The thing was so infernally
unexpected. Almost like Joe Weir himself
appearing. I didn&rsquo;t sleep a wink that night, what with
my heart being bad and what with seeing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose he <i>has</i> proofs?&rdquo; Vorse asked after a pause,
while his narrowed eyes moved from one to another of
his companions.</p>
<p>A considerable silence followed. The question jerked
into full light the issue that had all the while been lurking
in the recesses of their minds&ndash;&ndash;an issue full of
ghastly possibilities. Judge Gordon&rsquo;s fingers trembled
as he wiped with handkerchief the cold sweat on his
brow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in it,&rdquo; Vorse added.</p>
<p>Burkhardt brought his fist down on the desk with a
sudden crash.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he has proofs, then it&rsquo;s him or us,&rdquo; he exclaimed,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
while the blood suffused his face. &ldquo;Him or us&ndash;&ndash;and that
means him! I&rsquo;ll never go behind bars!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure not. None of us,&rdquo; Vorse said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Judge Gordon began in an agitated
voice, but did not finish.</p>
<p>Sorenson gave a nod of his head. His bear-trap
mouth was compressed in a determined evil line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly. He&rsquo;ll never use his proofs. We&rsquo;re in too
far to halt now if matters come to the point of his trying
to use them. He has a grip on us in one way; he
knows we can&rsquo;t declare his father, Joe Weir, did the
killing; that would make us&ndash;&ndash;what do you call it,
Judge?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accomplices after the fact. Besides, it would then
come out that we had taken over and shared among us
his stuff, fifty thousand apiece. It&rsquo;s a deplorable situation
we&rsquo;re in, gentlemen, deplorable. If we were but
able to start the story Joe Weir believed and fled because
of, it would cut the ground out from under this man&rsquo;s
feet at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s him we&rsquo;ll cut, not the ground under him,&rdquo; Burkhardt
growled, thrusting his hairy chin forward towards
the lawyer. &ldquo;And cut his damned throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate to think of our being forced to&ndash;&ndash;to homicide.
Even justifiable homicide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Homicide nothing! It&rsquo;s just killing a rattlesnake
waiting in the brush to strike. That&rsquo;s the way we used
to do in the old days, and if he&rsquo;s going to bring them
back that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ll do again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson smiled grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll wait till we&rsquo;re sure he has the proofs,
then&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll act quick and sure,&rdquo; Vorse shot out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And quietly,&rdquo; the cattleman added. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take no
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
more chances this time. It will be arranged carefully
beforehand; all four of us will be in it, of course,&ndash;&ndash;equal
responsibility; and there&rsquo;ll be no witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Judge Gordon&rsquo;s face wore a pallid, sickish look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope to God there&rsquo;s some other way out of it,&rdquo; he
muttered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So do all of us,&rdquo; Burkhardt snarled. &ldquo;But if there
isn&rsquo;t, it means guns. For you, too, along with the rest
of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson leaned forward and gazed from under his
heavy brows, compelling Gordon to meet his fixed look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were keen enough at the time for your share
of Joe Weir&rsquo;s stuff,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ll play the hand
out to the end now, the bad cards as well as the good.
You&rsquo;re no better than the rest of us, and it was you
who hatched the scheme for cleaning him up and who
put over the story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But&ndash;&ndash;but this would be too much
like cold-blooded murder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Murder!&rdquo; Sorenson grated. &ldquo;Did you look straight
into this fellow Weir&rsquo;s eyes? Didn&rsquo;t you see something
there that resembled murder? He&rsquo;d like only the chance
to kill us one by one with his own hands: I saw that
much. Just as Burkhardt said, it&rsquo;s him or us. After
you told me about him, I had only to take one look. If
he has the goods on us&ndash;&ndash;well, he&rsquo;ll have to die. Make
up your mind to that. We&rsquo;re back to the time of thirty
years ago and fighting for our lives. We were not only
all in on the Weir job, but the Dent killing&ndash;&ndash;all of us.
Remember that. If the facts become known, we&rsquo;ll be
run into some other county and court and hanged. And
every enemy we&rsquo;ve made in these years past will put up
his head and clamor for our blood. Let that sink into
your mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span></div>
<p>The effect of this low fierce utterance was to hammer
the truth home. The Judge was ashen. Vorse&rsquo;s face
appeared like an evil mask. Burkhardt glowered savagely.</p>
<p>At that instant there sounded the faint report of a
shot in the street. Then as the group sat unmoving,
rigid, keyed to the highest pitch of expectancy, there
followed quickly two more shots. Afterwards, silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A gun-play!&rdquo; issued from Vorse&rsquo;s lips, softly.</p>
<p>They all sprang up to hasten to the door.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h3>A SHOT IN THE DARK</h3>
</div>
<p>Steele Weir driving his car down the street in the
dusk had caught sight of Felipe Martinez standing near
the cattle company&rsquo;s office. He stopped close by, beckoned.
Martinez would do as well as another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a notary, I suppose?&rdquo; he questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Weir. Most of us lawyers here are,&rdquo; he
replied politely, when he had advanced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve some papers I want acknowledged to-night.
Must get them into the mail going down to Bowenville
in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only too pleased to facilitate your business, Mr.
Weir. My office is down a few doors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jump in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s but a few steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I&rsquo;ll get out here.&rdquo; And the engineer stopped
the engine and descended to the ground.</p>
<p>Along the street open doorways and windows were
already beginning to make yellow panels of lamplight in
the thin gloom. The air was still warm, balmy, scented
by the lingering aroma of the greasewood smoke of
supper fires in Mexican ovens. Stars were jeweling the
sky. Few persons moved in the twilight.</p>
<p>One of these was a man who, standing at the door of
a native saloon across the street and a little farther up,
had come diagonally over towards the bank on seeing the
engineer halt his car. He walked with a slouching haste
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
seldom exhibited by a Mexican and gained the spot as
Weir stepped out. There he slackened his pace while he
scanned the American with an intense, slow gaze that
the engineer, chancing to raise his eyes, squarely met.</p>
<p>The Mexicans always looked at him and fell silent
when he passed since he had shown who was master at
the dam. In the eyes of some was merely stupid curiosity,
in some a shrinking, and in many a half-veiled hostility.
That did not trouble Weir. In Mexico he had
dealt with recalcitrant workmen of more lawless nature
than these. He usually ignored them altogether now
as they no longer were in his employ. But this man
seized his attention.</p>
<p>It was not yet too dark to mark his face as he lounged
past, slowly turning his head about as he progressed
until his chin was on his shoulder, staring back. His
look the while remained riveted on Weir&ndash;&ndash;a steady, contemplative,
evil regard. In Chihuahua the engineer had
once seen a notorious local &ldquo;killer&rdquo; who had that same
gaze.</p>
<p>Martinez had also glanced at the fellow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that man? One of the discharged workmen?&rdquo;
Weir asked him, when moving forward they in
turn had passed the Mexican.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I imagine not. At any rate, he doesn&rsquo;t belong in
San Mateo or anywhere hereabouts. I know everybody
for fifty miles, for I&rsquo;ve been active in social and political
affairs. He&rsquo;s unknown to me. A stranger.&rdquo; Then a
little farther along: &ldquo;Here is my office, Mr. Weir. I&rsquo;ll
have a light in an instant. Ah, now. Be so good as
to have a chair and we&rsquo;ll expedite your business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Martinez filled out the acknowledgment blanks
on the papers, his eyes furtively skipped over the vital
portions of the documents. The latter were connected
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
with company business. He had hoped they would be
personal so that he might learn something more of
this manager&rsquo;s affairs, possibly more of his secret antagonism
for Sorenson and his friends. Any intrigue
appealed to the thin, slippery lawyer&rsquo;s soul, but most of
all some one&rsquo;s else intrigue into which he might profitably
put a finger. However, from these papers he was to
learn nothing.</p>
<p>He had considered all possibilities of the affair, all
possible solutions of what long ago might have occurred
between Joseph Weir, undoubtedly the father of the
man sitting across the table from him, and the four
men now conferring in Sorenson&rsquo;s office. This was no
petty squabble, he divined. There was something going
on under the surface that was big&ndash;&ndash;big! And very
dangerous too, for the spirit of that moment in Vorse&rsquo;s
bar was not to be mistaken; it had been tense, electric.
Utmost caution on Martinez&rsquo;s part would therefore be
necessary.</p>
<p>As between the two parties, his sympathies at present
inclined towards Weir. The refusal on the latter&rsquo;s part
to re&euml;mploy the Mexican workmen on their own terms
was purely a matter of policy, and the lawyer&rsquo;s first
gusty anger had long been forgotten. But not so Sorenson&rsquo;s
sneering words of that afternoon. They struck
to the heart of his vanity, breeding an animosity that
would last. Had not the banker stated that the lawyer
should hold no political office whatever? After all his
services? Had he not definitely shown that Martinez
might never expect anything there? Well, the lawyer
wasn&rsquo;t one tamely to yield his rights; he did not propose
always to remain a scrimping, pettifogging attorney,
existing on crumbs.</p>
<p>When with a flourish he had appended his name to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
the acknowledgments and affixed his seal, he sat back
thoughtfully studying the engineer, who was carefully
examining the paragraphs for errors. He knew his business,
did Martinez; the man would find no mistakes.
Then the lawyer&rsquo;s eyes suddenly glistened. He arose
and closed the door as Weir thrust the documents into
a stout linen envelope, addressed and stamped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be pleased to see your letter goes in the mail in
the morning,&rdquo; he said, returning to his place. &ldquo;The stage
leaves at eight-thirty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Post-office is closed now, I suppose. Very well. It
will be an accommodation,&rdquo; the engineer responded.</p>
<p>Martinez leaned forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you can spare the time, I should like to have a
little talk with you,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Pardon me if I appear
presumptuous, but as you&rsquo;re aware, Mr. Weir, I overheard
your words to Judge Gordon in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon. I
inferred&ndash;&ndash;check me at any instant if you consider this
none of my business!&ndash;&ndash;that there exists some unpleasant
feeling between you two gentlemen and possibly others.
Judge Gordon has always handled the company&rsquo;s business
in his private capacity of counselor. As you know,
he&rsquo;s a silent partner in many enterprises with Sorenson,
Vorse and a man named Burkhardt. They run this town
and county. You should also know that they&rsquo;re secretly
opposed to your irrigation project, whatever they profess.
They&rsquo;ve misled the people into believing it will
work an injury to this district, whereas it will of course
be beneficial. Unfortunately too they lead the people
by the noses&ndash;&ndash;but not me! I refuse to be subservient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused to note the effect of his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Weir, these are facts you can confirm if
you&rsquo;re not already informed of them, which I imagine
you are. Because I&rsquo;m independent in my opinions and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
actions, I stand in disfavor with these gentlemen, which
may or may not be an objection in your view to what
I have in mind. And this is it. I should be pleased to
execute any legal work that you care to give me; it
might be of advantage to your company at times to have
an attorney other than Judge Gordon, who is aligned
against you and will serve his own interests first. He&rsquo;s
in a position to cause you embarrassment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our eastern attorneys draw all documents.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course. But I was thinking of delays more than
anything else. There are a thousand ways a lawyer
can push or halt matters at will, and your project will
never be free of legal red tape until completed&ndash;&ndash;if then!
I&rsquo;m not unselfish in this, I admit; the business would
be valuable to me. But aside from that, I&rsquo;ll give you
this advice anyway:&ndash;&ndash;secure another lawyer in any case,
one without antagonistic personal interests, if you can
find another in San Mateo besides me. See, I&rsquo;m frank!
That may sound egotistical, but really I&rsquo;m the only
free man of the lawyers here. And I&rsquo;ve paid for my
liberty!&rdquo; He made a sweeping gesture to indicate his
shabby office. &ldquo;If I had taken orders, I could have been
county attorney and probably a judge. But I respect
myself too much to take orders from Sorenson and his
bunch. I choose this sort of thing in preference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele Weir maintained a non-committal silence.
Again the thin dark-skinned lawyer swiftly weighed the
man before him, considered the dangers in which he
might become involved if he went a step farther, recoiled,
then grew bolder. Sorenson had marked him for
poverty and nonentity; under the favoring shelter of
the irrigation company&rsquo;s power he might arise from
both. For at moments the acute Mexican sensed the
inevitable victory of the new forces at work; this, one
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
of the last strong-holds of old time cattle and sheep interests,
would break down and yield to the plow and
fence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, there&rsquo;s something more, though I hesitate to
mention it,&rdquo; he went on, doubtfully. &ldquo;While Sorenson
and his crowd run things, it&rsquo;s not because the people&ndash;&ndash;and
that means us Mexicans chiefly&ndash;&ndash;love them. We&rsquo;re
indolent by nature; we idle rather than work; borrow
when we can rather than earn&ndash;&ndash;I speak of our race, but
we&rsquo;re learning that work proves best in the long run.
These men have squeezed my people, and robbed them,
and kept them down. Nothing more would I wish than to
see these leaders deposed. It&rsquo;s no secret they&rsquo;ve built
their wealth by questionable methods, but who can prove
it?</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what I suspect? You have something
on Sorenson&rsquo;s crowd. That&rsquo;s why they&rsquo;re uneasy; that&rsquo;s
why the four are sitting over in the cattle company&rsquo;s
office this minute with their heads together, meeting the
minute Sorenson arrives home. I saw them go in. Leaving
aside the question of your own affairs, I&rsquo;d like to
have matters changed here in this county so that every
man has a fair chance. Anything that will bring that
about enlists my interest. When I heard your statement
to Gordon and saw his face, I knew there was something
in the past that alarmed him. I recalled a name I had
once run across when abstracting a title&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was not this ingenious twisting of the truth that
caused the lawyer to become filled with sudden dismay
and stop, but the savage hardening of the engineer&rsquo;s
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Weir commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the name was Joseph Weir. I looked it up
again to be sure, and found the property had been deeded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
to Sorenson and the others, who still have it. I wondered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you wonder?&rdquo; came with a devouring look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If&ndash;&ndash;if Joseph Weir received consideration according
to law.&rdquo; Martinez&rsquo; courage flowed back again. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
make no attempt to justify my curiosity, sir, except to
say that more than one man in the southwest was done
out of property in early days; and the practice has not
ceased, for that matter. But in these days the means
is usually legal and Mexicans the victims. Sharp mortgage
dealings and so forth. Now, if I&rsquo;ve said too much,
I&rsquo;ll instantly forget all about it. On the other
hand&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I might be of assistance. If you wish to look into
that old transaction, that is. If there was anything
crooked about the deal, and I set it down that there
was with Sorenson mixed in, and with Vorse and Burkhardt
the witnesses named in the deed and Judge Gordon
taking the acknowledgment of Joseph Weir&rsquo;s signature,
as the record shows, then there should be some
weak spot that could be attacked. There may be men
yet alive conversant with the circumstances; they may
know whether duress or fraud was exercised, supposing
the sale was not honest. Some of the old Mexicans may
remember Weir, and could give a clue; they have good
memories for things of those days. Of course, if the
transaction was all right, then I&rsquo;m all wrong in my
suppositions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can give you some of the company business, perhaps
considerable of it,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Martinez sprang up, an expression of gratitude upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span>
his face. He had not realized all that he had hoped for,
but he was nevertheless delighted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m really sincere when I give you a thousand
thanks, Mr. Weir,&rdquo; said he, spreading his arms wide.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not make promises as to the efficiency of my
services; let results speak for themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always do,&rdquo; was the comment. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you
what I demand in any one associated with me&ndash;&ndash;absolute
trustworthiness first of all, then loyalty and ability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which leaves nothing,&rdquo; Martinez smiled.</p>
<p>He preceded the engineer and swung the door open,
stepping aside. To the visitor&rsquo;s question regarding
fees for the acknowledgments taken, he waved a declining
hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing. Delighted to render you the
service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll attend to the letter,&rdquo; the lawyer again assured
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come out to the dam in a day or two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow, if you wish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow afternoon will do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele Weir&rsquo;s frame filled the lighted doorway as he
stepped forth from the office. He paused to accustom
his eyes to the darkness, for during his colloquy with the
attorney full night had descended. On the same side of
the street with himself and perhaps twelve or fifteen
paces off he saw a girl&rsquo;s figure appear and disappear before
a window as she moved along.</p>
<p>Then suddenly a tongue of red flame darted at him
across the street, where lay a space of unlighted gloom.
His hat was whipped off his head. The sharp report
of a shot cracked between the adobe walls. With an
unbelievably rapid movement Steele Weir drew the revolver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span>
in his pocket, and which he had carried ever
since his encounter with young Sorenson in the restaurant,
fired twice where he had seen the flame and leaped
aside into the darkness beside the doorway. There he
waited, half crouching, for a further attack.</p>
<p>But none came. Men began to run towards the place.
Shouts and calls echoed along the street. In two minutes
a crowd was surging before Martinez&rsquo; door wildly
asking questions.</p>
<p>Weir pocketed his pistol and walked back into the
office, where he found his bullet-pierced hat lying on the
floor and the attorney standing frozen with astonishment.
A stream of people followed at his heels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who did this shooting? Do you know, Felipe?&rdquo; a
tall raw-boned white man who led them asked hastily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This gentleman, Mr. Weir, was fired on, sheriff,&rdquo;
Martinez burst out volubly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I fired in return,&rdquo; the engineer stated. &ldquo;The
fellow was across the street in the dark. You might look
over there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Turning and pushing his way through the packed
door, the sheriff disappeared. The crowd melted away
again. Presently as Weir glanced about he saw a new
figure at the doorway, staring at him. He went towards
the girl there outlined in the lamplight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that you I saw moving along just before the
exchange of compliments, Miss Hosmer?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I was coming towards you on my way home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It probably gave you a fright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It did, indeed. I heard the shot and saw your hat
knocked off. I just went cold in my tracks. At first I
believed you killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very much alive, as you see.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62' name='page_62'></a>62</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But it was dreadful! Who would fire at you from
the dark? Some one tried to murder you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It looks like it. Still here I am, ready to move your
car out of the water next time it&rsquo;s stalled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She entered the room slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who in San Mateo would do such a terrible thing,
Mr. Martinez?&rdquo; she addressed the lawyer. The pallor
was still on her face and her eyes were large with horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Miss Janet, if we but knew! We&rsquo;d lay hands
on him and send him to the penitentiary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Real emotion struggled in the lawyer&rsquo;s words. With
the return of his senses he had just begun to realize by
what a narrow margin the assassin&rsquo;s bullet had missed
destroying his future client and prospects.</p>
<p>A growing murmur across the street attracted their
attention. Then as they continued to chat of the event,
the sheriff reappeared, directing half a dozen men who
laid a burden in the light of Martinez&rsquo; doorway.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got him,&rdquo; he said to Weir, with ominous significance.
&ldquo;One bullet through the head, one through
his stomach. He&rsquo;s good and dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir walked forward and inspected that outstretched
figure. It was the man whose gaze had been so malevolently
fastened upon him as he joined Martinez before
Sorenson&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A strange Mexican. Some of these men say he
showed up this morning and hung around the saloons,
not talking much. Haven&rsquo;t you ever seen him, before?&rdquo;
The question expressed a perplexed curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Once. When Martinez and I were coming here to
transact some business. He was taking a good look at
me then when he passed us. That wasn&rsquo;t over half an
hour ago. Never saw him before that.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63' name='page_63'></a>63</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;He shot at you first?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had just stepped out of this room. Could I see
him hiding over there? Or know he was there?&rdquo; Then
he added, &ldquo;I was taken by surprise, but I marked the
flash of his gun.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff, Madden by name, looked at Weir appreciatively.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can use a gun yourself,&rdquo; said he, briefly.</p>
<p>Martinez now repeated the fact of the dead man having
fired the first shot, which Janet Hosmer confirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, is there anything more?&rdquo; Weir questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night, I reckon,&rdquo; Madden replied. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
have an inquest in the morning; show up then. Where
will I find your father, Miss Hosmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At home.&rdquo; Then to the engineer she explained,
&ldquo;Father acts in the absence of the coroner, who&rsquo;s away
just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry this happened on your account,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m very glad you were not hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Outside the corpse was being borne away, followed
by the curious, avid crowd of Mexicans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re still shaken by the thing,&rdquo; said Steele Weir.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough to upset any girl. Let me walk home with
you, or you may be starting at shadows all the way.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h3>JANET HOSMER</h3>
</div>
<p>A silvery brightness shone in the east as they came
out of Martinez&rsquo; office, that increased as they went forward
until all at once the moon arose into view, lighting
the street, disclosing the flanking lines of squat buildings,
revealing the tall cottonwoods about the court
house and elsewhere thrust up in the town.</p>
<p>Janet Hosmer breathed a sigh of relief. The darkness
had seemed potent for further evil, but now it was
as if the latter retreated with the shadows. She felt a
desire to go on alone, to separate herself from this companion
with whom chance had brought her in contact
at a dramatic moment, to get away from the whole
terrible affair. Involuntarily her spirit shrank at the
nearness of the man, for though he had struck back in
self-defense he nevertheless had killed another and the
act somehow appeared to set him apart from ordinary
men, isolate him, give him the character of an Ishmael.</p>
<p>Yet her feelings were confused. Against this inclination
was an avid curiosity, or rather a wonderment, as
to what must now be occurring in his soul. Her eyes
sought his face as he walked beside her. Neither had
spoken; and his countenance wore the same stern contained
aspect, calm, forceful, as the first time she had
ever observed it. But what was below the surface?
What were the thoughts now revolving in his mind and
the emotions flowing in his breast? She could read
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65' name='page_65'></a>65</span>
nothing on that composed mask of a face. Was it possible
for a man to slay another human being, even justifiably,
without suffering a hurricane of the spirit?</p>
<p>But perhaps he had killed men before. The fact of
his carrying a weapon and his swift deadly fire pointed
ominously to previous experience.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you ever shoot any one before?&rdquo; popped from
between her lips. Then she stopped, clapping her hand
over her mouth in consternation and staring at him
palely.</p>
<p>Weir had halted too. He regarded her in silence for
a little, a slight smile resting on his face. They stood
before the cattle company&rsquo;s office and his look went past
her once to embrace the small darkened building.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a murderer by trade, if that&rsquo;s what you
mean,&rdquo; said he, at last. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve killed a man or two
before, yes.&rdquo; Then at the white anguish of her lips and
cheeks, his tone softened a degree as he went on. &ldquo;Unfortunately
since becoming of age I&rsquo;ve had to fight. If
not men, then the earth. If not the earth, then men.
Sometimes both together. You saw what happened to-night;
that fellow was unknown to me. He was not a
workman who had been discharged and felt he had a
grievance&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no!&rdquo; she interjected. &ldquo;The Mexicans here
wouldn&rsquo;t attempt to murder you, however angry they
might feel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure of that,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I am; I know them, I&rsquo;ve lived among them!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let that go. The man tried to kill me, at any
rate. However, he was merely a tool, hired for the
business by some one else. Ordinarily I don&rsquo;t discuss my
affairs with any one, but since you&rsquo;ve raised the matter
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66' name='page_66'></a>66</span>
I&rsquo;ll just say that I&rsquo;ve enemies in San Mateo who are
anxious to dispose of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such enemies here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Who would be delighted to see me lie where
that dead man lies and who are apparently determined
to effect it.&rdquo; He touched her sleeve warningly. &ldquo;But
you will speak of this to no one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, oh, no! Not a word!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele gazed at her steadily. He already repented
disclosing even so little of his private concerns, an impulse
altogether at variance with his close-mouthed
habit, but he had, for some vague reason, felt it necessary
to explain his course, to justify himself to this
clear-eyed, fine-spirited girl. He could not let her rest
under a misapprehension that he was a brute who reveled
in blood-spilling. And as he regarded her a conviction
that she was absolutely to be trusted settled
firmly into his mind.</p>
<p>She would be staunch; oxen and ropes could not drag
information from her once she had determined not to
speak. Yes, she would be loyal to her given word&ndash;&ndash;and
to her friends. Weir&rsquo;s eyes glanced at the diamond on
her finger. It would be a girl like her with whom he
would have chosen to mate if fate had not directed his
feet on a road which seemingly left him no choice but
incessant and solitary struggle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate it all; I have nothing but crusts and nettles!&rdquo;
he exclaimed, with sudden fierce passion. And with a
quick movement of his hand he beckoned her on.</p>
<p>Submissively she accompanied him, her bosom rising
and falling with a quickened rhythm. Too much had
happened, one thing piling on another, for her to sort
her thoughts or to attempt to understand things yet;
and in her tossing state of mind she went at his gesture
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67' name='page_67'></a>67</span>
as one follows a guide, or as a simple matter of course.</p>
<p>In her mental turmoil that last passionate utterance
of the man played like a lambent flame. Tense, violent,
spontaneous, it had come from the heart. What
harsh lot he had lived and sufferings borne she could
not even guess; but no man spoke with such unconscious
bitterness who had not undergone pain and travail of
spirit. His head was now turned a little towards her
as they walked: she perceived him staring at the moonlit
street, his lips compressed, his brows knit.</p>
<p>Then he glanced about at her, his face clearing.
&ldquo;Pay no attention to what I said,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I
shouldn&rsquo;t have let loose that way. Hello, what&rsquo;s on
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before them, and in front of the court house, was a
packed crowd, people who had run forth at the sound
of shots, augmented by those who had since arrived
upon the scene. It was motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back, stand back; don&rsquo;t trample the body!&rdquo;
came Sheriff Madden&rsquo;s voice in an angry order.</p>
<p>The crowd surged a little apart in the center.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this dead man fired the first
shot?&rdquo; asked some one, vehemently.</p>
<p>The voices went lower so that Steele Weir and Janet
Hosmer, who had paused at the edge of the throng,
were able only to catch the tones.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who was that who questioned the sheriff?&rdquo; Weir
whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Burkhardt, I think. Sounded like him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So intent were the Mexicans upon the occurrence in
their midst that those close by remained with backs
towards the pair, failing to notice their presence. All
craned eagerly to miss nothing of the controversy.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68' name='page_68'></a>68</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know this engineer didn&rsquo;t start it?&rdquo;
came Burkhardt&rsquo;s voice again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool; there were witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to talk to those witnesses. I doubt if they
really saw anything. It looks to me as if there&rsquo;s another
side to this shooting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of course you know&ndash;&ndash;you, sitting there in
Sorenson&rsquo;s office, as you say,&rdquo; was the ironical retort.</p>
<p>At this juncture another voice interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madden, we want no mistake here. This Weir
doesn&rsquo;t bear a very good reputation for peacefulness,
from what I&rsquo;ve learned. If this Mexican has simply
been shot down&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is that?&rdquo; Steele demanded of the girl. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s speech faltered&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;that is
Mr. Sorenson. Oh, they misunderstand! Let me push
in there and tell them how it happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer&rsquo;s hand closed about her arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the kind,&rdquo; he commanded, low.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Remain quiet and listen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her eyes flew up to his at this extraordinary course,
so injurious to his own interests. She was anxious to
press to the front and declare his innocence in the affair
of everything but defending his life from an assassin.
She could not understand why he also was not eager to
spring forward, why he restrained her. Then she saw
the implacable hatred on his face.</p>
<p>A thrill quivered through her body. The feeling she
had at that instant was one of being on the point of
seeing behind the curtain of a mystery, of making a
discovery so sinister that she would gasp. Her very
finger almost rested upon it. Why were Mr. Sorenson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69' name='page_69'></a>69</span>
and Mr. Burkhardt talking as they were? Trying by
innuendo to make it seem her companion might have been
guilty of a crime? Could it be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; Her blood slowly
congealed to ice at the horror of where her reasoning
led.</p>
<p><i>Could it be they were the enemies he meant!</i></p>
<p>Such a thing was too dreadful, too absurd. They, the
respected leaders of the community, could never put a
pistol in the dead wretch&rsquo;s hand to slay this man beside
her. Mr. Sorenson! The father of Ed, whom&ndash;&ndash;&ndash; She
stared blankly at her left hand.</p>
<p>Yet the banker&rsquo;s heavy, smooth words continued to
assail her ears steadily. She grasped their import once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&ndash;&ndash;for the story is too thin. No man could hit
another across the street in the dark as this engineer
claims, not only once but twice put a bullet where it
would kill. Probably the dead man had something on
this Weir, and the latter knew it. It&rsquo;s not impossible
he found the fellow in his path, drew and murdered him
at once, quickly put a hole in his own hat and then
carried the body across the way, running back to Martinez&rsquo;
office. The thing could have been done in a
minute. Martinez&rsquo; himself wouldn&rsquo;t have seen how it was
worked. I&rsquo;m not saying that was exactly how it was
done, or that this Weir did actually murder him, but&ndash;&ndash;investigate,
Madden, investigate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele Weir felt an angry tug at his sleeve. He looked
around and beheld Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s eyes distended with
incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come away, come away,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;I should
never have believed it if I hadn&rsquo;t heard with my own
ears!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Keeping close to the line of buildings, they skirted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70' name='page_70'></a>70</span>
the crowd, still unnoticed, and left it behind. She
walked with quick nervous steps; her hand yet unconsciously
grasped his coat sleeve. All the way to her
home, which they found dark since a messenger had
called the doctor to the court house and the Mexican
girl servant also was gone, she said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come up on the veranda; I want to talk,&rdquo; she announced
when he opened the gate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t it be best if you took your mind off the
whole thing, by a book or something else? I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As if I could take my mind off! There are matters
in this I must know. You may wonder when I say it,
Mr. Weir, but this happening concerns me more than
you dream.&rdquo; Her dark glowing gaze brooded on him
with a sort of intense determination. Then she went on,
&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;it involves my whole future as well as your own,
though in a different way. So come inside, if you
please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir in silence accompanied her upon the dark, broad,
vine-clad porch. In the half-gloom he found chairs for
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to the point at once,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;Why
did Mr. Sorenson talk in such a fashion?&rdquo; And he
could feel her bending forward as if hanging on his
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the one thing I can&rsquo;t discuss,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must know, I must know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And unhappily I must refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Weir, if you could but understand what
this involves for me, you wouldn&rsquo;t hesitate! I was
shocked at the shooting, but I saw its necessity on your
part; you&rsquo;re not one to run from a foe, a cowardly foe
least of all. But what I heard there in the street horrified
me. I couldn&rsquo;t believe it; I can scarcely credit my
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71' name='page_71'></a>71</span>
ears yet. Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Burkhardt were not
near when you were attacked; they are not acquainted
with the circumstances or facts as you, Mr. Martinez
and I know them; they apparently didn&rsquo;t appear until
the crowd started away with the dead man. Yet at
once&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ay, at once,&rdquo; Steele Weir let slip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, immediately, when they had barely heard
the story, they began to tear it to pieces and suggest
another, making you out a villain. You&rsquo;re only an acquaintance,
sir, scarcely more than a stranger, but as
I listened it outraged all my sense of justice. Mr.
Sorenson, of all men! My brain was in a whirl. But
it&rsquo;s steady now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer failed to open his lips at her pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no fool, Mr. Weir; I think of other things besides
dressing my hair and using a powder puff. I can
sometimes put two and two together&ndash;&ndash;when I see the
&lsquo;twos&rsquo; clearly. Now, tell me why Mr. Sorenson talked
as he did, for I must have my eyes clear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ask me anything but that, Miss Hosmer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He sat distressed and uneasy at her prolonged muteness.
Suddenly she questioned quietly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are those two men the enemies you spoke of?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will save me embarrassment if I go,&rdquo; he remarked,
starting to rise. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to hate me, you
know, and still I can&rsquo;t say anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her grasp pulled him imperatively back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not go yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I can only continue to decline making answers.
I frankly say that I regret having uttered a word of
explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t regret it. And I intend to keep questioning
you, however rude you may think me. I must know,&rdquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72' name='page_72'></a>72</span>
she cried impetuously, &ldquo;and I shall know! Mr. Sorenson
is one of the men you referred to, or he would never
seek to direct suspicion at you. I saw the look on your
face, sir, as he spoke. But why should you two be
enemies! You come here a stranger to San Mateo, or
have you been here before sometime? Did you know
him before?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again he could feel her eyes straining at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems mad to think of him and Mr. Burkhardt,
and perhaps others, hiring some one to shoot you down
from a dark doorway. It is utterly mad&ndash;&ndash;crazy. But
why should they want to convict you, in the crowd&rsquo;s
opinion at least, of murdering the man. It would not
be just trouble about the dam&ndash;&ndash;oh, no. But I can&rsquo;t see
through it at all. Why won&rsquo;t you tell me? You can
trust me&ndash;&ndash;and I want to help you as well as help myself.
You certainly don&rsquo;t hold against me my silly nonsense
and unkind words of the day you brought me home from
the ford.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think them silly; they delighted me,&rdquo; he responded.
&ldquo;I hadn&rsquo;t had anything happen to me so refreshing
in years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must be friends. Something tells me they&rsquo;re
going to make you trouble over this shooting, and you&rsquo;ll
need friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something tells me you&rsquo;re right in both respects,&rdquo;
he laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And friends must stick together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they should do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the dusk of the vine-clad, flower-scented place
where they sat he experienced the subtle power of this
intimacy. Not a soul stirred in the empty moonlit
street before the house. No sounds disturbed the warm
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73' name='page_73'></a>73</span>
peace of the night. In this secluded spot only there
ran the murmur of their voices.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could never stand by and see any man unjustly
accused and defamed if I knew he was innocent, without
lifting up my word in defense,&rdquo; she proceeded. &ldquo;But
let me ask if on your side you&rsquo;re treating me fairly?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir could have groaned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a noble spirit, Miss Hosmer. You&rsquo;re more
courageous and kind than any girl I&rsquo;ve ever known.
Would you have me reveal what my best judgment tells
me should remain untold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what of me? Would you keep it to yourself if
my future happiness might turn on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The appeal in her words shook Steele&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does this business affect your happiness?
How?&rdquo; he asked, in perplexity.</p>
<p>Now it was her turn to hesitate. Why should she
pause, indeed, before telling to this man what every one
else knew. Yet hesitate she did, from a feeling she could
but partly analyze. Of her fianc&eacute; she had already had
disturbing secret doubts that had increased of late:
doubts of his habits, his character and the genuineness
of his love; so that it was with a little eddy of dissatisfaction
and shame that she admitted the relationship.
More she questioned her own love as an actual thing.
In a startling way, too, this silent, forceful man, so
deadly in earnest and so earnestly deadly, so terrible in
some aspects, seemed at the instant to dwarf the other
in stature and power as if the latter were a plump manikin.</p>
<p>Perhaps at the last minute she had a shiver of dread
at what might issue from the engineer&rsquo;s lips in the way
of facts if he took her at her word and told her what
she had demanded to know. Did she want to know?
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74' name='page_74'></a>74</span>
Suppose she let the affair rest where it was and went
forward to the future in the comfortable assurance of
ignorance.</p>
<p>In that case, it might be wooing later revelations that
then could not be escaped, revelations like consuming
lightnings. She would settle it now once for all.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does concern my future and my happiness vitally,&rdquo;
she declared, earnestly. &ldquo;For this reason&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m engaged to marry Ed Sorenson, son of Mr. Sorenson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir leaped to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God! That fellow!&rdquo; he exclaimed, astounded.</p>
<p>Without another word he sprang down the steps and
strode away. Janet Hosmer, grasping the arms of her
chair and staring after him, saw him once bring down
his clenched fist on nothing. Then he passed rapidly
along the street and out of sight.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h3>IN THE COIL</h3>
</div>
<p>The Spirit of Irony couldn&rsquo;t have devised a more
intolerable situation. So thought Steele Weir as he
strode away from the dwelling, still laboring under the
emotions provoked by the girl&rsquo;s disclosure, wincing at
his own biting thoughts and writhing at his own helplessness.
It needed only this revelation to cap the
whole diabolical evening.</p>
<p>He could not have remained with her now if his life
had depended on it. She, engaged to that scoundrel
Ed Sorenson! How could she have been so blind to the
lustful beast&rsquo;s nature? She must love him, of course.
He must have been careful to exhibit to her only such
qualities as would gain her affection and respect, or
rather hollow shams of qualities he never had possessed.
Propinquity, lack of rivals in this little town, no doubt
were largely responsible for her feeling for the man.
But it was like standing by and seeing her fair young
body, her fresh pure life, her high soul, flung to a devouring
swine.</p>
<p>And by the rules of the game he couldn&rsquo;t open his
lips to utter a word of warning! That was the worst
of it, that was the worst of it. No, not by the rules of
the game; not, for that matter, by the rules of life; for
the latter run that only can the person concerned see
with his or her own eyes what a loved one&rsquo;s character
is, and must make and abide by her own judgments.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76' name='page_76'></a>76</span></div>
<p>Steele Weir all at once stopped in his tracks. He
stared straight before him for a time seeing Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s
face as it appeared when she anxiously gazed at
him from Martinez&rsquo; door, coming out of the night like
a pallid moon-flower. At that instant she had feared
he had been wounded; her heart was fluttering with
anguish. The tension of his body relaxed and his hands
slowly unclosed and involuntarily his eyes went up to
the moon sailing serenely in the sky above the treetops
and the flat-roofed adobe houses. What vaster blessing
could life bestow than to have such a look come seeking
one beloved!</p>
<p>He went on thoughtfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She shall not marry him,&rdquo; he said to himself, with
a quick resolve.</p>
<p>What were the rules of any game when an innocent
girl&rsquo;s happiness was at stake? Did he care for conventions,
or even the contempt she herself might feel
for him for apparently belittling her lover? He could
stand that, so that her eyes were opened and the fellow&rsquo;s
yellow heart made plain. At the proper time he
should act, view his part as she might. A snap of his
fingers for being misunderstood! He would go his own
way afterwards.</p>
<p>The thing had its curious features, too. No mistake,
the shock of hearing Sorenson senior talking to the
sheriff and the crowd, working up sentiment, had stirred
her indignation and wonder and uneasiness and alarm.
She was no fool, as she had said. She had a clear, practical
mind, give it something to work on. Her intuition
had immediately grasped the fact that there might
be cellars under the Sorenson household of which she
knew nothing and which should be promptly entered with
a strong light. Whether the momentary desire would
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77' name='page_77'></a>77</span>
last, that was the question. To-morrow, or the first time
she found herself in Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s reassuring presence,
she might consider that her brain had been upset by
events of this night, jiggled awry in a sort of moonlight
madness, and her apprehensions as to happiness unfounded
shadows.</p>
<p>Well, Weir would strike later.</p>
<p>He turned into the main street. Evidently the body
of the dead Mexican had been carried into the jail behind
the court house, or somewhere. The throng had
dispersed, though its elements were every place talking,
in pairs or in little knots of people. As he came along,
these fell silent at his passing. They stared at him,
motionless, expressionless, with the characteristic Mexican
stolidity that is the heritage of Indian blood. By
his automobile he found Martinez posted, stroking his
long black mustache and regarding Sorenson&rsquo;s office,
which was still lighted though the curtain remained
drawn over the broad plate-glass window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just wanted to give you a whispered word,&rdquo; he said,
in Steele Weir&rsquo;s ear, darting a glance towards some of
the Mexicans who, drawn by insatiable curiosity, were
lounging nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said the engineer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came out of the office after you did and heard the
talk.&rdquo; He made a covert movement of forefinger
towards the nearby building. &ldquo;The four of them are in
there again. I saw you listening to Sorenson here in the
street; and would you care to have me express my opinion
as to what the signs indicate, Mr. Weir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the light of what I suggested during our talk in
my office, the silly twaddle of Burkhardt and Sorenson
is understandable. I look right through their scheme.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78' name='page_78'></a>78</span>
They always frame up something against anybody they
want to dispose of; they do it in business matters regularly,
and very skillfully. They immediately perceived
a chance, sir, in this unfortunate encounter of yours
and laid hands on it; their talk was the first delicate
maneuver to &lsquo;frame&rsquo; you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; was the unperturbed answer.</p>
<p>Martinez laid a finger on Weir&rsquo;s lapel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, feeling hasn&rsquo;t been good towards you because
of the work controversy at the dam,&rdquo; he went on,
with another swift glance about. &ldquo;They will use that.
On the other hand, you have Miss Janet and me as witnesses
in support of your story. Unfortunately Miss
Janet is, as you may not be aware, engaged to&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez paused dramatically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Ed Sorenson,&rdquo; the lawyer half-hissed. &ldquo;Nothing
could be worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Look at the position she&rsquo;ll be in. Consider the
pressure they can put on her through that fact&ndash;&ndash;and
they&rsquo;ll not hesitate to do so, in one way or another.
Innocent as a dove, she is, Mr. Weir.&rdquo; He thrust his
head forward, showing his lips drawn apart and shining
teeth tight set. &ldquo;And she&rsquo;s never heard a rumor of his
hushed-up affairs with poor, ignorant, Mexican girls
who knew no better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll simply have to trust to her courage to tell the
truth on the proper occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but they&rsquo;ll trick her some way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez straightened, smiled, twirled his mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I? They aren&rsquo;t quite foxy enough for that, Mr.
Weir,&rdquo; he boasted, with glistening eyes.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79' name='page_79'></a>79</span></div>
<p>The engineer was almost ready to believe that, but
cunning was not the only weapon in his enemies&rsquo; arsenal.
How would this lean lawyer stand up under intimidation,
bribes, threats?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust so, Martinez,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Do you think they
will try to get me sometime by an out-and-out gun-play?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they could if they tried?&rdquo; Weir inquired,
grimly.</p>
<p>The attorney paused with finger and thumb on the
point of his mustache, lifted his eyebrows and smiled
broadly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll consider twice before they attempt it, after
your expert exhibition this evening,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;It was
amazing, your speed, your accuracy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele tapped the man on the breast, who experienced
a distinct tremor at that significant touch and at the
veiled menace in the dam manager&rsquo;s eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s always one bullet in my gun for the man
who betrays me, Martinez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer licked his lips. On general principles he
disliked statements that committed one to the future.
But it was necessary to say something.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To be sure. I should feel the same in your circumstances,&rdquo;
he responded. Then as Weir turned to his
car, he continued: &ldquo;The inquest to-morrow morning
should be over early. I&rsquo;ll visit you in the afternoon as
planned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that letter,&rdquo; Weir called out.</p>
<p>Martinez marveled. Kill a man, and still remember a
letter! That magnified his respect immensely. Cool,
that fellow! Then a slight shiver as if a chill from
those black peaks west of the town had struck through
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80' name='page_80'></a>80</span>
his flesh rippled along his spine; for he had been over
at the jail with the crowd and had viewed that dead
body lying there on the stone floor. Not only cool, but
dangerous and deadly, this engineer. He, Martinez,
must be discreet; it would not do to risk gaining Weir&rsquo;s
enmity. That cold-faced man could not be &ldquo;monkeyed
with.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez gnawed his mustache and eyed the dully illuminated
office window. He wondered if those four men
inside had not at last found their match, perhaps their
master. Any one with half a brain could see there was
going to be a desperate struggle between the four and
the one, and he was not exactly sure yet that he wanted
to venture farther into the affair. But the very danger
fascinated him with its subtle and obscure features, exactly
suited to his manipulation.</p>
<p>A man who had been standing apart sauntered nearer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; he addressed the lawyer in Spanish.</p>
<p>Martinez whirled about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, it&rsquo;s only you, Naharo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a bad fighter, eh?&rdquo; And the man, almost white
because of intermixed blood, moved a hand in the direction
Weir&rsquo;s car had gone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not bad. Quick with a gun, however,&rdquo; was
the careful reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With his fists also. I saw, or if I did not see, I very
nearly did so&ndash;&ndash;it is the same&ndash;&ndash;saw him use them in Bowenville.
And on that dog of an Ed Sorenson who would
have seduced my little Dolorosa, as he did Cristobal&rsquo;s
daughter, if I had not perceived what he was at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer&rsquo;s ears were instantly pricked up. He
caught the man by the shirt-sleeve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come with me,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Once they were in his office he carefully closed and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81' name='page_81'></a>81</span>
locked the door, drawing the window shades. Literally
he rubbed his hands one over the other as he bade
Naharo take a chair. Then the pair of them rolled and
lighted cigarettes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I should say no more, Se&ntilde;or Martinez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will go no farther. And if the engineer and Ed
Sorenson had a fight, then it must have been for that
reason the latter&rsquo;s father spoke as he did to-night. You
heard him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And I did not understand why. It was not because
of what happened at Bowenville, unquestionably
not, for it had to do with another girl&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, a girl! And the engineer mixed in it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. As I say, he would not have told his father,
because he keeps such things quiet; it is four years since
he last had to pay money to settle a matter. Some
think he now behaves, but it is not true. But he is more
careful. So his father did not know about this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell it all, Naharo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other inhaled a puff of smoke and half-closed his
eyes. Though nearly white, he retained the Mexican&rsquo;s
high cheek bones, and languor, and unforgiving nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was in Bowenville, freighting up flour to the store
of Smith&rsquo;s. I had loaded by evening, to make an early
start next day. I had gone into the restaurant for
supper, taking a seat far down at the end of the counter
near the kitchen. I was tired and thinking only of my
food. As I ate, there was a crash in one of the stalls
and I looked about. There was a fight, of course. But
it ended at once. Then I observed Ed Sorenson come
out presently, jerking his collar and tie straight. He
was mad. He had been whipped, too. For he yet looked
as if he wanted to kill the other man in there, but he
went away. Soon the other man came out and with him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82' name='page_82'></a>82</span>
was a young white girl, whom I did not know. The
man was this engineer and he carried an old piece of
baggage, not such as he would carry but as the girl
might, for she looked like a ranch girl who was poor.
The girl was scared. The man was calm as a priest.
That scoundrel Ed Sorenson had been beaten. Aha,
so; it was clear. The engineer had put a spoke in the
fellow&rsquo;s wheel. Then I walked to the door and saw the
two get into a car and start on the trail this way. After
that, I resumed my supper. You perceive, the man had
taken the girl away from the wolf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez&rsquo; restless eyes wandered about the room as
he digested this account.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you see the dead man?&rdquo; he inquired, casually.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Their looks met, held for an instant, dropped. Each
read the thought of the other: the motive for the attack
on the engineer was clear. But some convictions
are better not expressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have liked to see Se&ntilde;or Weir do the shooting,&rdquo;
Naharo stated. &ldquo;Dios, such shooting! Two
shots, two hits. And in the dark!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez&rsquo; grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not please&ndash;&ndash;whoever hired the dead man. He
was hired for the job, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unquestionably, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; was the reply.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h3>THE GATHERING STORM</h3>
</div>
<p>At the inquest next morning no outward sign indicated
what Weir&rsquo;s enemies might be at. Indeed, none
of them was present. The engineer made a statement;
the two witnesses, Janet Hosmer and Felipe Martinez,
were briefly interrogated, and the finding was returned
that the unknown Mexican had met death from two
bullet wounds while attempting to kill Steele Weir.</p>
<p>One spectator there was who took a strong interest
in proceedings, Ed Sorenson. When, however, Janet
Hosmer was notified by her father, who was in charge,
that she could withdraw, the young fellow hastened to
lead her away, with an audible remark that it was a
shame she had had to be &ldquo;dragged into this disreputable
gun-man&rsquo;s bloody show.&rdquo; Meaning Steele Weir, naturally.</p>
<p>That feeling was being intensified against him was
only too apparent in the hostile manner of the crowd
and in the silence with which it received the finding.
There was his former unpopularity, to begin with; there
was now added a race resentment, for the slain man,
stranger though he was, was Mexican; and finally, he
knew not what distilled poison of lies concerning his
innocence in the night fray. Nothing more was needed
to reveal the swelling hate which secret fear of Weir
but increased than a volley of curses and abuse hurled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84' name='page_84'></a>84</span>
at his head from a native saloon doorway as he passed
in his car on his way home.</p>
<p>During the following week the engineer was too occupied
with dam work to have time for other matters.
He pushed the concrete construction and inspired his
men with something of his own indomitable spirit, who
had learned of the cowardly attack in San Mateo and
rallied to his standard with a zeal and ardor for which
the fact of employment alone did not account. He had
become a leader as well as their &ldquo;boss.&rdquo; From Meyers
down to the humblest workman the camp had for him a
new admiration, a new respect and a new loyalty, which
he could not help but feel; he had proved that he could
deliver the &ldquo;goods&rdquo;; and if the Mexicans wanted war,
the Americans here would be glad to oblige them. Nor
did they wait to let San Mateo know the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re wid &lsquo;Cold Steel&rsquo; Weir, our boss, four hundred
of us, till ye can skate on hell,&rdquo; a huge Irishman, one of
half a dozen standing at Vorse&rsquo;s bar on Saturday night,
remarked when the saloon-man uttered a sneer at the
manager. &ldquo;Say that agin and we&rsquo;ll tear your rotten
booze joint to pieces and make ye eat it! And if another
stinkin&rsquo; greaser tries to wing him from the dark,
we&rsquo;ll come down here and wipe your dirty little town off
the map! That goes both ways from the jack!&rdquo; He
snapped his fingers under the other&rsquo;s nose by way of
added insult.</p>
<p>A petty series of hostile acts against the company
developed. Teamsters were stoned by boys, which left
them raging and murderous to discover the men who
set them on. Half a carload of cement in sacks was
ripped open and emptied on the earth at Bowenville.
After Meyers, Weir&rsquo;s assistant, found his automobile
tires slashed to bits on coming out of the post-office in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85' name='page_85'></a>85</span>
San Mateo, it became necessary always to go in pairs,
one man to remain on watch. Weir himself just avoided
a serious accident one evening at dusk while a mile from
the dam when he instinctively ducked in his car as something
grazed the top of his wind-shield. A wire had been
stretched across the road from a telephone pole to a
tree, at just the height to strike him at the throat.</p>
<p>He halted and removed the deadly contrivance. Men
on watch of his movements could have prepared it
against his return; and, indeed, he thought he detected
a pair of flitting shadows behind a row of willow bushes
lining a Mexican irrigation ditch, but in the dusk he
could not be sure. On running thither, he found no
one.</p>
<p>The camp was not of a temper, however, to allow the
attacks to be all on one side. Atkinson, the superintendent,
came to Weir one morning towards the end of
the week and informed him workmen were drifting down
to San Mateo nightly in hope of trouble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll get a knife put into them,&rdquo; Steele Weir replied,
with a frown that did not entirely hide his satisfaction
at this evidence of support.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe; and again maybe not,&rdquo; the superintendent
stated, grinning. &ldquo;A bunch jumped some of our boys
last night and I guess when the dust settled there were
a couple of Mexicans beaten nearly to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call the men all together this noon,&rdquo; Weir ordered.</p>
<p>At that hour he gave them a talk for what he called
their long-eared cussedness, and laid down a little law
and wound up with a number of reasonable explanations
for the same. Every man who went out hunting trouble
was a camp liability, and would be fired. He did not
propose to give the town authorities a chance to jail
workmen and impair the dam work, just the thing they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86' name='page_86'></a>86</span>
were waiting to do. The men should keep away from
San Mateo, or at least avoid disputes and rows. If they
spent no money there whatever it would sting the town
where it would hurt the most, in its pocket-book; and
he himself was transferring the company bank account
to Bowenville, by way of example. If any man felt
the need of change from camp, he could have two days
off at the end of the month to spend at Bowenville. But
keep away from the Mexicans!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they come up here huntin&rsquo; us when we show
up no more?&rdquo; yelled the same big Irishman who had
paid his respects to Vorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case, tear their heads off,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;But put on your gloves first or you&rsquo;ll dirty your
fingers.&rdquo; Which bit of rough humor caught the crowd&rsquo;s
fancy and won a roar of laughter.</p>
<p>Later as the crowd dispersed to eat Atkinson said to
Meyers, &ldquo;The boss knows how to handle men all right,
all right; he put sugar on the pill. The gang went off
grinning. They know they&rsquo;ve got to be good&ndash;&ndash;but only
up to a limit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meantime Felipe Martinez had not been idle. He
rode up to engineering headquarters on his pony one
evening and carried Weir out into the open where their
words would not be overheard. He reported that he
was quietly working for information of Weir&rsquo;s father
among the older Mexicans who would be likely to remember
him, but proceeding cautiously so that no one
would suspect his purpose. He represented himself to
them as undertaking to write a history of San Mateo
County; he must depend upon them for data of early
days; it would be a fine book bound in leather, in which
their names and possibly their pictures would appear;&ndash;&ndash;which
never failed to flatter the parties with whom
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87' name='page_87'></a>87</span>
he talked. And the lawyer laughed with amusement
as he related the success of his method.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have already seen some thirty or forty people,
a few of whom recalled your father, but no more. But
this afternoon,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I discovered a woman
who worked at the Weir ranch house.&rdquo; Martinez perceived
the engineer&rsquo;s attention quicken. &ldquo;She said the
Weirs had a little boy of four years of age, perhaps
five. You, Mr. Weir, of course. They suddenly paid
and discharged her one day, packed a trunk and drove
hurriedly off; and the next morning Sorenson took
possession of the ranch and she went home. They
drove off in a great haste&ndash;&ndash;there was no railroad anywhere
near here then&ndash;&ndash;and that was the last she ever
saw or heard of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing more there was: she said there was a
story that went around for awhile afterwards that
Weir and another had lost their ranches and cattle
gambling. For that reason Weir left the country;
and for that reason, too, the other man, Dent, by name,
committed suicide in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon where they had
gambled. She said Saurez, an old man living with his
son up a little creek, would know about that, for he used
to clean out Vorse&rsquo;s bar-room in those days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele Weir grasped Martinez&rsquo;s shoulder in a quick
grip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He did! Get everything he knows out of him,&rdquo;
he commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave it to me, Mr. Weir. I understand how to
wheedle facts out of these old fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was doubtful if the engineer heard his words.
He had dropped his hand, stood opening and shutting
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88' name='page_88'></a>88</span>
his fingers, while on his face grew the hard implacable
look that always whetted the attorney&rsquo;s curiosity.</p>
<p>Weir walked up on the hillside when Martinez had
ridden away and there sat down on a rock. It was a
rift, though but a faint rift, that this news made in the
blank dark wall he had to confront; and he wished to
think. Proof as well as knowledge of what had happened
in his father&rsquo;s case was what he must have. Acting
on intuition he had been able to put fear into the
hearts of the four men responsible for making his father&rsquo;s
life a hell, but proof of their guilt was necessary
to make them suffer in a similar fashion, to reveal their
crime to the world, to destroy them. Now at last, here
was a possibility. If this former roustabout of the
saloon knew anything!</p>
<p>Well, he must be patient&ndash;&ndash;the mill of the gods grinds
slowly. But when finally he had gained all the strands
and woven the net! Unconsciously his hands arose before
his face like talons closing on prey and shut on air,
until their veins swelled. That was how he would serve
them, those men. Though they might fall on their
knees and implore mercy, not one beat of pity should
move his heart.</p>
<p>It was almost dark when he arose. Behind him the
great peaks soared against the last greenish twilight.
In the shacks the camp lamps were showing at windows.
At one side and in the canyon the concrete core of the
dam appeared white in the gloom, like a bank of snow.
The murmur of voices, an occasional distant laugh,
came from men&rsquo;s quarters.</p>
<p>Presently he slanted down the hillside past the camp,
until he struck into a road leading towards town, where
he began to walk forward, hatless and without coat,
through the soft dusk. He was disinclined for work as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89' name='page_89'></a>89</span>
yet, the work always piled on his desk; he desired yet
for a little to rest his spirit in the evening calm.</p>
<p>His thoughts had softened and turned to Janet Hosmer.
He had not seen her since the morning at the
court house. He had not spoken with her since that
interview upon her veranda, which had terminated
with his shocked utterance. That he had thus given
away to his feeling he had a hundred times repented;
and that he had so bruskly departed he was profoundly
chagrined. But what could he have done? No explanation
was possible. The situation in which he had
been allowed of but one thing, escape.</p>
<p>With the rising tide of emotion reflected by memory
of that moment his steps had quickened. All at once
he discovered before him the rippling sheen of water.
He was at Chico Creek, a mile from camp, where he first
had met Janet Hosmer. Engaged with his tangled problem,
he had been unaware of the distance covered.</p>
<p>Pausing but an instant he waded through, smiling to
himself at thought of that afternoon&rsquo;s spirited encounter
with the girl. She had not dreamed then, nor he,
that events would fling them together in a more dramatic
second meeting at Martinez&rsquo; door.</p>
<p>Suddenly he perceived a white-clad figure before him,
standing motionless, leaning forward to peer his way
as he walked forth from the ford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s you, Mr. Weir?&rdquo; came in soft inquiry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. How in the world do you happen to be here,
Janet Hosmer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I recognized you marching through the
stream, so I wasn&rsquo;t alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one would think of harming you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90' name='page_90'></a>90</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But anyway I should have vanished if you had been
a stranger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not being one, you remained. I had no idea of
such luck as this when I set out for a walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both pleasure and satisfaction sounded in his voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was just taking a little stroll myself,&rdquo; said she.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h3>AN UNEXPECTED ALLY</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;Let me take the chance first thing to apologize for
my behavior the night we talked on your porch,&rdquo; Steele
Weir exclaimed. &ldquo;Your statement of being engaged
surprised me into words and conduct that has had me
in an unhappy state of mind ever since. Mr. Sorenson&rsquo;s
talk to the crowd stirred my anger. Had I known
your exact relationship to him and his son, I should
have made no mistakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had urged you to speak, had I not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Grant that. But I don&rsquo;t stand excused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no questioning the sincerity of your
last expression that night, in any case,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;ve not been indignant because of what you exclaimed
or because you hate the Sorensons. &lsquo;Hate&rsquo;
isn&rsquo;t too strong a word, is it? I&rsquo;m none the less interested
however to know what it&rsquo;s all about. You see
I don&rsquo;t take any stock in the reasons commonly given:
that you&rsquo;re a &lsquo;bad man,&rsquo; an agent of a rich corporation
trying to put our people out of business, a public
menace and all the rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what they say?&rdquo; Weir asked, with a laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Part of it. Nor does it fool father, for he said
only yesterday that there&rsquo;s something more at bottom
of the feeling against you than merely a fight of moneyed
interests. He knows from what I told him that
that dead man tried to murder you; yet he hears constant
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92' name='page_92'></a>92</span>
talk of your &lsquo;crime,&rsquo; of evidence being gathered
against you by the county attorney, Mr. Lucerio, and
of the penalty you shall pay. All absurd, to be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Martinez tells me the same,&rdquo; Steele responded.
&ldquo;But he says also that all the people do not believe the
stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true.&rdquo; And she appeared to reflect upon
the circumstance.</p>
<p>To Weir nothing could be stranger than this talk
on the dark road with the girl who, too, should be naturally
opposed to him. In fact, here at this very spot
and at their first meeting she had announced herself as
a critic and an enemy. He could smile over that now;
she herself probably did smile at the recollection. Yet
she was calmly discussing his situation without animus
or even unfriendliness.</p>
<p>How could that be possible if she actually loved
the man whom she expected to marry, Ed Sorenson?
Why did she not at once spring to arms in defense
of the Sorenson side? Unless&ndash;&ndash;unless she suspected
the baseness of her lover and his father, and fear had
replaced love.</p>
<p>All at once she spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will put you in jail if they can, and bring
you to trial, and&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And hang me, that&rsquo;s what you hesitate to say,&rdquo;
Steele finished for her. &ldquo;Whom do you mean by
&lsquo;they&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the people here in this county really &lsquo;they&rsquo;?
Do the people, that is, the mass of poor ignorant Mexicans,
have anything to do with public affairs? Both
you and I know they do not.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why deny it!&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s generally known
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93' name='page_93'></a>93</span>
that four men, with a few more at their skirts, run
things. They nominate the men who are to fill office&ndash;&ndash;there&rsquo;s
only one political party in the county worth
mentioning&ndash;&ndash;and give them orders and expect them to
obey. For that reason father would never accept an
office. He could be coroner; he could be county treasurer;
he could go to the legislature; or anything else&ndash;&ndash;if
he would but wear their political livery. But he
prefers to be a free man. I used to think nothing of it,
see no wrong in such a state of affairs, for everything
went along well enough and about the same as ever as
far as I could see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly you didn&rsquo;t see everything that was occurring
below the surface even then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly what father told me yesterday. We talked
about everything under the sun, I imagine. And I
informed him that you walked home with me the night
of the shooting; I had not spoken of it before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was proper; he should know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t share in the feeling against you, Mr.
Weir, let me assure you of that. Ever since he heard
my explanation of the shooting and then met you at
the inquest, he&rsquo;s convinced that you&rsquo;re being done a
great injustice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele experienced a warm glow of pleasure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I liked your father at first sight,&rdquo; said he, simply.
&ldquo;But where does all this leave us?&rdquo; He spoke in a
light tone of amusement that he was far from feeling.
&ldquo;Our position is&ndash;&ndash;odd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; she assented so earnestly that he began to
laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t allow it to disturb you. I&rsquo;m really
presuming upon your kindness of heart and innocence
in enjoying your company now. Acquaintance with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94' name='page_94'></a>94</span>
me is a rather serious matter here in San Mateo and
carries consequences. You don&rsquo;t think for an instant
that I&rsquo;d allow my personal pleasure&ndash;&ndash;and pleasure it
is to be with you, needless to say&ndash;&ndash;to bring you into
ill-favor among your friends and to make you the subject
of gossip. I appreciate your good spirit towards
me; and I admire you greatly. But it will be well if I
admire you at a distance hereafter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see whose business it is except mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To Steele Weir it was like pushing aside the only
thing that brightened his hard, toilsome existence thus
to abjure future companionship with her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, do you fancy that comes easy for
me to say?&rdquo; he exclaimed, drawing a deep breath. &ldquo;I
never before knew any one who&ndash;&ndash;well, I&rsquo;ll stop there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who what?&rdquo; she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I nearly overstepped the bounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What imp of perversity was in the girl? Weir
stared at her for a moment through the gloom.</p>
<p>And then she remarked that she must be returning
home, and said she would be glad if he would accompany
her part way as there was a Mexican&rsquo;s house half
way to town where a particularly vicious dog always
rushed out. The dog rushed out exactly as she had
predicted, barking savagely, so that she slipped her
arm into the engineer&rsquo;s and held fast until they were
past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He does that only after dark; I hadn&rsquo;t expected to
walk so far and it was still light when I set out,&rdquo; said
she.</p>
<p>The touch of her fingers on his sleeve, the light
swing of her form at his side, the subtle fragrance that
emanated from her hair and face, this intimate nearness
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95' name='page_95'></a>95</span>
on the dark road, the heavy scent of flowers in
the bordering fields,&ndash;&ndash;all sent the blood thumping from
his heart. If he&ndash;&ndash;if he were in Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s place,
what love he could pour out!</p>
<p>Ed Sorenson, the double-faced wretch who while engaged
to her had attempted to entice away for his own
vile gratification the simple, trustful girl on Terry
Creek, he was to marry this sweet and charming companion.
What diabolical tragedies life could mix!</p>
<p>&ldquo;See, the moon is rising,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Over the edge of the mesa the yellow globe was
bulging, rayless for the moment, round and full.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re almost at the edge of town, and I&rsquo;ll stop
here,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;As I said, I&rsquo;d not bring down upon
your head a single unpleasant word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My head&rsquo;s not so tender,&rdquo; she responded quickly.
&ldquo;But I think you&rsquo;re right&ndash;&ndash;for the present.&rdquo; A tight
little smile followed the words. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I propose to stand by you. I told you that
night I couldn&rsquo;t remain indifferent when I saw an innocent
man persecuted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You give me a tremendous amount of happiness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I do, I&rsquo;m glad. I don&rsquo;t believe you ever had
much of it. Do you know what is said? That you
never smile. But I can swear that isn&rsquo;t true, and I&rsquo;m
beginning to wonder if you really are&ndash;&ndash;Heavens, what
was I about to say!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. It&rsquo;s nothing terrible, I wager.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I won&rsquo;t finish that, but I&rsquo;ll ask a question
even more impertinent, if I may. Frankly, I&rsquo;m dying
of curiosity to know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir turned his head to listen to the approach of a
horseman. He could see the man galloping towards
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96' name='page_96'></a>96</span>
them for town, having turned into the road from a lane
a short distance off, his horse&rsquo;s hoofs striking an occasional
spark from a stone. Then the engineer looked
smilingly at Janet Hosmer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you anything&ndash;&ndash;or almost anything.&rdquo; One
subject alone was sealed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Cold Steel.&rsquo; How did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was just pinned on me a few years ago. I&rsquo;m not
particularly proud of it. I don&rsquo;t even know the rogue
who gave me the label. And it means nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even your enemies are using it,&ndash;&ndash;and I understand
what it signifies.&rdquo; She bent her eyes upon him for a
time. &ldquo;That is, what it signifies to your friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And to my enemies?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More gossip. They say it&rsquo;s because you&rsquo;re a gun-man
and a knife-man. Oh, I wish I didn&rsquo;t have to have
my ears filled with such vicious slander! But it means
the same to enemies as to friends if they would but
admit it. I&rsquo;ll wait until this rider passes, then I must
go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No thought of friends or foes, both, or of any such
person as Ed Sorenson in particular, was in Steele&rsquo;s
mind as he made answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d stand here forever if you didn&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; he said,
with a low eagerness that caused her breath to flutter
in spite of herself.</p>
<p>On her part, her mind was whispering, &ldquo;He means
it, I believe he really means it.&rdquo; Which caused her to
lift and lower her eyes hurriedly, and feel a peculiar
sense of trepidation and excitement. Odd to state, she,
too, just then had no recollection of any such being as
Ed Sorenson, which was the extreme of unloverliness.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97' name='page_97'></a>97</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Before I do go, I&rsquo;ve something to tell you,&rdquo; she
said hurriedly, dropping her voice. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s this: the dead
man&rsquo;s name was&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;here her tone went down to a mere
sibilance&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Pete Ortez.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He leaned forward, once again the hard fierce man
she had seen in Martinez&rsquo; office the night of the shooting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you learn that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&ndash;&ndash;well, it was let slip inadvertently in my presence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir would not press her further. Nor was there
need, for the sudden embarrassment on her face and
indeed the information itself could have but one source,
the man who knew, Ed Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re the equal of a thousand ordinary friends,&rdquo;
he declared. &ldquo;I can make use of that item. Step aside,
please; we&rsquo;re in the middle of the road.&rdquo; And he drew
her from in front of the horseman advancing upon
them.</p>
<p>They said nothing, but waited for the man to pass.
But he pulled his mount from a gallop to a trot, and
from a trot to a foot pace, and at last when squarely
even with them came to a full stop. From under his
broad hat brim he silently considered the girl in white
summer dress and the bare-headed engineer.</p>
<p>Then he began to shake with laughter, which lasted
but an instant. So insulting, so sinister was that
noiseless laugh that Janet&rsquo;s hand had flown to Weir&rsquo;s
arm, which she nervously clutched. As for Weir, his
limbs stiffened&ndash;&ndash;she felt the tightening of the arm she
grasped&ndash;&ndash;as a tiger&rsquo;s body grows taut preparatory to
a spring.</p>
<p>The short, fleshy, insolent rider sitting there in the
moonlight was Burkhardt.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98' name='page_98'></a>98</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ed Sorenson better keep an eye on his little turtledove,&rdquo;
he remarked. And touching heel to his animal
he swung ahead for town.</p>
<p>For one dazed minute they stared after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shoot him!&rdquo; she suddenly said, through shut teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t my gun along, or I&rsquo;d be glad to oblige
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deserves killing, the wretch!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On more accounts than one,&rdquo; he replied, quietly.</p>
<p>So quietly and so gravely, in truth, that her gust of
rage subsided before the low-spoken menace of the
words. No quick anger was his but a steady and
deadly purpose. Again she felt the hard-held force,
the mystery of the man, as if flowing suddenly upward
from subterranean channels. What wrong had he
suffered, what undeserved torture at the hands of this
man and others thus to freeze his soul?</p>
<p>But he immediately turned to her, asking, &ldquo;Does that
upset the broth?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A wan smile greeted his words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect it will keep the cook busy, anyway,&rdquo; she
said.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h3>BY RIGHT OF POSSESSION</h3>
</div>
<p>Janet Hosmer made no effort to guess what her
fianc&eacute; would say when next he called, or to prepare a
defense of explanations and excuses. She was not that
kind. What was necessary to be stated at the proper
time would arise to her lips. Nevertheless she had a
heaviness of heart, a natural distress as to the unpleasantness
in prospect; and had only the slightest hope
that Ed would ignore or refuse to hear Burkhardt&rsquo;s
story. The man would tell her lover, of that she might
rest assured, out of hatred for the engineer if for no
other reason.</p>
<p>She knew how passionately Ed was set against Steele
Weir, for a score of times she had heard his incensed
opinions, increasing lately to tirades. It had seemed
strange at first that one could be so bitter over a simple
difference like that of who should work at the dam.
But ever since Weir had uttered his hoarse exclamation
regarding her engagement, words so full of protest
and amazed indignation, she was aware the cause
went deeper.</p>
<p>At that moved ejaculation of her companion that
night something, too, had settled on her heart like a
weight&ndash;&ndash;an indefinable foreboding. The anxiety
aroused about Ed&rsquo;s father and his integrity came to
include Ed likewise. Loyalty of course required that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100' name='page_100'></a>100</span>
she accept the man she had promised to marry, without
reservations. As between him and others there
should be but one choice. But did she really know
him? Was he simply the open, jolly, generous, upright
adoring fellow he appeared? Or were there less pleasant,
more ignoble sides to his character? Was he, as
well as his father, capable of a mean, unworthy, selfish
persecution of another?</p>
<p>The engineer had made no open accusation against
him&ndash;&ndash;or against any one, for that matter. She had
done her best to get him to express himself, but he had
refused. Enemies he might have, but he would not discuss
the fact beyond admitting it was true. Only at
moments when his restraint slipped could she measure
his feelings. Quite different that from Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s
voluble, heated denunciations of the other. Yet,
heavens, how appalled this reserved man had been at
hearing of her engagement! Far more than words, far
more than any open charge, did his face and incredulity,
both so patently sincere, bespeak the mistake she
was making and justify gnawing doubts of her lover.</p>
<p>As she approached her home Ed Sorenson came
dashing out to spring into his runabout waiting before
the gate. At sight of her he pulled up short.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here you are,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, here I am,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You doubtless know what I&rsquo;ve been told,&rdquo; he stated,
significantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t. I can only suspect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it true you&rsquo;ve been meeting this man Weir on
the quiet? Meeting him while engaged to me? You
know what I think of him, and what every other respectable
person thinks of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that Mr. Burkhardt&rsquo;s report? That I am
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101' name='page_101'></a>101</span>
meeting Mr. Weir on the quiet, to use your words?&rdquo;
she countered.</p>
<p>Sorenson made an angry gesture at what he considered
an evasion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet, listen. He said he saw you at the edge of
town, that you were both bare-headed, standing close
together, arms locked. Good heavens, can&rsquo;t you imagine
my feelings on hearing what he had to say! He
stopped me on the street and drew me aside to put me
on my guard, he said. Burkhardt wouldn&rsquo;t just make
up a yarn like that against you, and he&rsquo;s a good friend
of mine. He didn&rsquo;t say half what he suggested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl turned her face towards the house, shut her
eyes for an instant. She could picture the rider&rsquo;s
brutal leering face and unspoken insinuations; and
her brain also placed in the scene her lover greedily if
angrily drinking in the tale. Harkening to it instead
of knocking the man down, that was the worst of it.
Harkening&ndash;&ndash;and believing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not deign to resent your remark of meeting Mr.
Weir &lsquo;on the quiet&rsquo;,&rdquo; said she, quietly. &ldquo;I met him on
the road accidentally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think I&rsquo;m entitled to know something
about it?&rdquo; he asked, with an edged tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is it you desire to know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Nearly an oath of wrath escaped his mouth, but he
kept his control.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet, you know what kind of a man he is,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;You know what I feel against him, and father,
and all our friends, and the town. And the whole town,
too, will probably hear of this, with a lot of gossip
added that isn&rsquo;t true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I met him accidentally.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102' name='page_102'></a>102</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to chat with him like an old
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet Hosmer gave him a slow, meditative look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know how I talked with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You talked with him. That in itself was too much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t view it in that light,&rdquo; she responded. &ldquo;He
was perfectly civil. Whatever public opinion may be
regarding the shooting, I know he killed the man in self-defence.
So that&rsquo;s nothing against him. You would
have done the same in his place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ed Sorenson leaned towards her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were mistaken, Janet. I&rsquo;ve said before that I
feared you were, but the prosecuting attorney has witnesses
to the gun-play that he&rsquo;s dug up. Martinez saw
nothing; how could he from inside the office? And
remember that you&rsquo;re only a girl, Janet; in the darkness
and with the excitement you were confused. I
haven&rsquo;t a doubt this scoundrel Weir made you believe
you saw what never occurred, when you appeared in
Martinez&rsquo; office. When you&rsquo;ve thought it over, you&rsquo;ll
realize that yourself. These new witnesses tell just
the reverse of what you fancied happened. I&rsquo;m going
to see that you&rsquo;re away from San Mateo when the
man&rsquo;s tried, as he will be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No reply coming from her, he continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deceived you then and he&rsquo;ll endeavor to poison
your mind right along. You&rsquo;re too trustful. Now, I
was angry at first, but if there was anything in this
meeting to-night that was out of the way, it was his
doing, I know. If he got familiar with you, as Burkhardt
hinted&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll kill the dog with my own hands!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103' name='page_103'></a>103</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You may rest easy. His conduct was irreproachable,
Mr. Burkhardt to the contrary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson regarded her in perplexity, divided between
anger and doubts. Too, a new feeling unaccountably
sprang into his breast&ndash;&ndash;jealousy. In the
end apprehension all at once filled his mind, darkening
his face and bringing down his brows.</p>
<p>Uneasy as at first he had been after the row in the
restaurant, he had eventually dismissed the matter from
his mind, for no rumor of it had reached San Mateo.
Neither Weir nor Johnson, the girl&rsquo;s father, had
blabbed of it, so his alarm passed; they didn&rsquo;t want
to talk of it for the girl&rsquo;s sake, any more than he
wished it known, was his grinning conclusion. The
deuce would have been to pay if Janet had got wind of
the business. But now his fears came winging back a
hundred-fold as he stared at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did he say to you?&rdquo; he asked, in a tense
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not that tone with me, if you please.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson, however, was past observation of her mood
or temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told you a lot of lies about me, didn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo; he
went on, not hiding the sneer. &ldquo;And you believed
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t say much, but what he did say was to
the point. I don&rsquo;t recall that there were any lies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There were, of course. It would be just his chance
to give you his made-up story about me and that Johnson
girl. That was what so interested you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t say anything about you and any girl
except me. Then he only said he was sorry he couldn&rsquo;t
have the pleasure of my friendship&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104' name='page_104'></a>104</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Ay-ee,&rdquo; the other grated. His lips worked above
his teeth.</p>
<p>A shudder passed over Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s skin at the
sound and the sight, for she had never seen him like
this. A cold hand might have been closing about her
heart: his glare was animal-like and bestial. His nature
at the instant stood unclothed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he said he would be at pains to avoid even
chance meetings with me, because it would make talk
and cause me annoyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not meet you another time if I have anything
to say about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see. But I wanted you to understand that he
told me no lies, nor repeated any story&ndash;&ndash;about you and
a Johnson girl, I think you said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A visible breath of relief lifted his breast. He now
would have been glad for some one to boot him along
the street for ever mentioning the thing. He almost
had put his foot in it. Apparently she was not interested
in seeking further knowledge of the subject that
he so ill-advisedly had brought up. Lucky for him she
hadn&rsquo;t the inquisitiveness of some girls.</p>
<p>The narrow escape restored a trace of his good
humor, and he was shrewd enough to divert her mind
before the incident made an impression. He reached
out and patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think me a scold, darling,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Burkhardt
upset me with his news, that was all. He hates
that gun-man so much that it&rsquo;s no wonder he was angry
at seeing him hoodwink you. He probably imagined a
lot. Just don&rsquo;t speak to Weir if he tries to stop you
again. And pretty soon we&rsquo;ll have him where he won&rsquo;t
interfere with anybody.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When will that be?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105' name='page_105'></a>105</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;The county attorney&rsquo;s still collecting evidence.
Nothing will be done before the grand jury meets, which
is in a couple of weeks. You must arrange to go off
on a visit about that time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you won&rsquo;t have to go through the ordeal of
appearing in court. There are ways of fixing such
things.&rdquo; He laughed softly. &ldquo;Especially here in San
Mateo County. It&rsquo;s too rotten a business for you to
have to step into, this murder. Come along down to
the drug store and have some ice cream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to-night. I&rsquo;m feeling a little tired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then let us rest on your porch. I haven&rsquo;t seen
you twice in the last week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some other evening, Ed. I promised father to help
get up his account books.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not angry with me?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re
not, give me a kiss before I go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A sharp smile showed on her lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not angry, but I&rsquo;m going to penalize you to
that extent. If you must have a cheek to press, go
kiss&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; She paused, while the conviction darted into
his mind that she had remembered that Johnson girl
blunder after all, then said: &ldquo;Mr. Burkhardt&rsquo;s cheek.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again relief swept him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, be kind, Janet,&rdquo; he began. But she was
already through the gate and skipping up the walk,
vanishing in the gloom of the veranda. The screen
door clapped shut. &ldquo;Peeved, all right. I&rsquo;ll have to be
extra-nice to her for a day or so until she calms down,&rdquo;
he murmured to himself. &ldquo;Must send her a box of
chocolates and some magazines to-morrow to show my
contrite heart; that always gets &rsquo;em. Hang it, it&rsquo;s
time to fix a day, too. We&rsquo;ve been engaged long
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106' name='page_106'></a>106</span>
enough. She sure has a figure and face&ndash;&ndash;a beaut! I
guess she didn&rsquo;t smell the booze on my breath. Got to
be careful about that till we&rsquo;re married.&rdquo; He jumped
into his car.</p>
<p>The screen door had clapped shut, but Janet had not
entered. She had employed the artifice to convey the
impression it had. She did not wish to go in to her
work just yet, for calm as she had appeared during the
interview her emotions were running full tide. Love
Ed Sorenson? Marry him? She groped for and
dropped into a wicker chair, her head sinking in shame
and self-abasement. Never&ndash;&ndash;never!</p>
<p>And before her mind swam another face, a face with
the hair ruffled about the brow, clear of eyes and
strong-lined, as she had beheld it in the moonlight of
the road.</p>
<p>All at once she tugged at a finger, fiercely pulling
off the engagement ring. She rubbed her cheek as well,
with an angry hand, for the memory of kisses was burning
her as by fire.</p>
<p>Then she sat quite motionless for a long time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just ask father,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t
be more than a dozen Johnsons around here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which would have given Ed Sorenson a fresh jolt
in his breathing apparatus if he had overheard, and
shriveled the cocky self-assurance with which he sipped
a high-ball that moment at Vorse&rsquo;s bar.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h3>JANET AND MARY</h3>
</div>
<p>In a region as sparsely settled by white people as
San Mateo and its adjoining counties there were not,
as Janet put it, more than a dozen Johnson families.
In fact, there were but two, she learned from her
father: one at Bowenville, the small railroad town of
three hundred people, a merchant with a wife and four
little children; the other a rancher on Terry Creek,
whose wife was dead and who had one child, a girl of
sixteen or seventeen years of age.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I may be away at dinner time, so don&rsquo;t wait for
me,&rdquo; she told her father next morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
out in the country a few miles&ndash;&ndash;and you know my car!
If you&rsquo;d just let me squeeze some of these patients who
never pay, you could have a new car yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; he smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But mine isn&rsquo;t. Look at it. You gave it to me
only because you scorned to ride in it any longer yourself.
It would do for me, you said, but you prance
around in a bright shiny one yourself. I blush at the
row mine makes; sounds like a boiler factory; I drive
only along side streets. If the patients would pay
what they owe, I could ride like a lady instead of a
slinking magpie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The doctor leaned back in his chair and laughed
(they were at breakfast) and remarked that old friends
were best.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108' name='page_108'></a>108</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t call my asthmatic tin beast a friend; we&rsquo;re
bitter enemies,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>It carried her to Terry Creek about noon, however,
safely enough, whither she went with a firm resolution
that crushed a certain embarrassment and anxiety.
Suppose these people resented her inquiries.</p>
<p>She placed the bearded, tanned rancher at once, when
she saw him working on a piece of harness before the
door as she drove up. She had seen him in town at different
times. She once had stopped here, too, several
years previous when accompanying her father, who had
been called to dress the rancher&rsquo;s injured hand. The
girl could not have been over twelve or thirteen then,
a shabby, awkward girl wearing a braid who came out
to gaze shyly at her sitting in the car.</p>
<p>Johnson arose from the ground and approached as
she alighted, while the girl&rsquo;s head popped into sight
at the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Dr. Hosmer&rsquo;s daughter, Janet,&rdquo; she stated, putting
out her hand and smiling. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to see you
on a matter. Shall we go into the house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With curiosity sharing a vague hostility in his bearing
he led her in, where his daughter was setting the
table. Janet also told the girl who she was. At once
dismay and startlement greeted the announcement.
But she invited Janet to be seated, she herself withdrawing
to a spot by the stove.</p>
<p>No need for Janet to beat about the bush with her
errand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come to you and
your daughter for a little help if you can give it.&rdquo;
That seemed the best way to break down their reserve,
an appeal rather than simply blunt questions&ndash;&ndash;and
what was it if not an appeal? &ldquo;What I have to say is
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109' name='page_109'></a>109</span>
just among the three of us and I know it will go no
farther. You&rsquo;re acquainted with my father; he&rsquo;s respected
by every one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is,&rdquo; Johnson stated, nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation is this, to speak plainly: last night
I heard something that has caused me to come to you
for information; I&rsquo;m engaged to Ed Sorenson, and in
a moment of anger he denounced Mr. Weir, the engineer
at the dam, for having told me a false story&ndash;&ndash;lies&ndash;&ndash;about
him and your daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet perceived the quick, troubled look exchanged
by man and girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir has never mentioned your daughter&rsquo;s
name in my hearing; I think him incapable of discussing
any one maliciously. He&rsquo;s very careful of what
he says. I consider him a very honorable man. At any
rate, he said nothing of what Ed Sorenson suggested,
and if the latter himself hadn&rsquo;t spoken of the thing
I should have had no inkling that there had been anything
justifying an inquiry on my part. There may
not be. But why should he imagine Mr. Weir had told
me &lsquo;lies&rsquo; linking him and your daughter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know Weir&ndash;&ndash;and I know Ed Sorenson, too,&rdquo; was
the rancher&rsquo;s grim rejoinder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a disagreeable subject, I know. But I&rsquo;m
not here out of mere curiosity, but a desire to learn if
something has been concealed from me by Ed Sorenson
that I should be informed of. His manner, his
words, the whole incident has filled me with doubts.
See, I&rsquo;m trusting you absolutely.&rdquo; And she extended
a hand in a gesture bespeaking sincerity.</p>
<p>Johnson peered at her in silence from under shaggy
brows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ask myself why Mr. Sorenson took it for granted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110' name='page_110'></a>110</span>
that the engineer had been telling me false stories and
if there was any ground for such fears,&rdquo; she went on.
&ldquo;He had nothing to be afraid of, no matter what might
be said, if he had done nothing unworthy. I can&rsquo;t
imagine Mr. Weir, for instance, being alarmed in that
way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re telling plenty of lies about him, for that
matter, but I guess it doesn&rsquo;t worry him any,&rdquo; Johnson
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I ask you touches a delicate subject, perhaps,&rdquo;
Janet continued, reluctantly. &ldquo;You may feel
that I&rsquo;m pushing in where I&rsquo;m not concerned. But if
Mr. Sorenson has done anything discreditable&ndash;&ndash;if he
has acted in a way to make me ashamed when I know,
then it becomes a matter affecting my happiness too.
I would never marry a man who had done something
dishonorable, for if I did so knowingly I should be dishonored
and dishonorable as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson suddenly thrust a brown forefinger at her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you want to know what Sorenson did?&rdquo; he demanded,
wrathfully.</p>
<p>Janet gripped her hands together. &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not go spreading it all around the country?
But I guess you won&rsquo;t as long as it would make you
out a fool too. I&rsquo;ll not have Mary&rsquo;s name dragged
about in a lot of gossip.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I assure you I shall remain silent, for her sake and
my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll tell you. You&rsquo;re too good a girl&ndash;&ndash;any
decent girl is&ndash;&ndash;to marry Ed Sorenson. He met
Mary at a dance last spring in town where she went
with some friends of ours, and made love to her but
wouldn&rsquo;t let her tell me or any one. We don&rsquo;t get to
town so very often; she never knew he was engaged
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111' name='page_111'></a>111</span>
to marry you, there never happening to be any mention
of it to her. Then he got her to go to Bowenville
one day awhile ago, under promise to marry her there&ndash;&ndash;Mary
is only sixteen, a little girl yet. To me, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet felt the working of his love in those simple
words. Felt it but half-consciously, though, for her
own soul was stifling at Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s revealed infamy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When he got her there, he told her they would have
to go away farther to be married&ndash;&ndash;to Los Angeles.&rdquo;
Again his finger came up, this time to be shaken at her
like a hammer. &ldquo;He never intended to marry her; he
planned to get her there, ruin her, and cast her off.
That&rsquo;s the sort of man you&rsquo;re going to marry!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I remember he expected to be away for a couple of
weeks&ndash;&ndash;a business trip, he said. But afterwards he explained
that it hadn&rsquo;t been necessary to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A business trip! Yes, the dirty kind of business
he likes. And if it hadn&rsquo;t been that Weir heard him
explaining to Mary that she must go on and interfered&ndash;&ndash;there
in the restaurant&ndash;&ndash;Ed Sorenson might have
succeeded. Mary trusted him, thought he was straight.
But he&rsquo;s crooked, crooked as his old man. When Weir
told him to his face what he thought of his tricks, he
let it out he was engaged to you. Didn&rsquo;t mean to, of
course. Weir said he would stay right with them and
see that they got married next day before a minister,
then Sorenson snapped out he was to marry you. That
opened Mary&rsquo;s eyes, that and his refusing to go before
a preacher as the engineer demanded. So Weir brought
her home to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that isn&rsquo;t all I know,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;Mexicans
and cowboys and others have talked&ndash;&ndash;women don&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112' name='page_112'></a>112</span>
hear these things&ndash;&ndash;how he&rsquo;s had to pay Mexicans hush-money
for girls of theirs he&rsquo;s wronged. But what do
people care? He&rsquo;s rich, he&rsquo;s old man Sorenson&rsquo;s boy;
everything&rsquo;s kept quiet; and he goes around as big as
life.&rdquo; With a muttered oath he turned away, his lips
shut hard and his beard sticking out savagely.</p>
<p>He came back to her again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The young one gets it from the old one,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Bad crooked blood in both of them. I
know. I&rsquo;ve been here ever since I was a boy and remember
things Sorenson believes every one has forgotten,
I know how he got his start, how he and the
rest of his bunch cleaned out Dent of his ranch and
cattle gambling and then killed him when he discovered
they had used marked cards, how at the same time they
robbed another man&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet struggled to her feet. She had covered her
eyes and bowed her head before the torrent of his vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more, I want to hear no more,&rdquo; she gasped.
&ldquo;Let me go home. I&rsquo;m sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It all makes me sick, too,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Sick
and sore, both. But it&rsquo;s the truth. I&rsquo;m sorry if it&rsquo;s
been a bad pill to swallow, but it&rsquo;s the God&rsquo;s truth,
girl. I&rsquo;m sorry it couldn&rsquo;t be any other way, but I
wouldn&rsquo;t see you marry that scoundrel if I lost a hand
stopping you. Mary felt sick at first, too; she&rsquo;s over
it now. You&rsquo;ll not feel bad long. Better stay for dinner
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swallow a bite. Thank you for your
kindness in asking me&ndash;&ndash;and for telling me what I
wanted to know, too. Father never knew, or he would
have warned me. People saw I was engaged to Ed
Sorenson and would say nothing to father, of course.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113' name='page_113'></a>113</span>
I shall always count you as one of my best friends, Mr.
Johnson. And you too, Mary; you must come down
and stay with me sometime, for I imagine you get lonely
here. No, another day I&rsquo;ll remain to dinner&ndash;&ndash;and I
want to be alone now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They pressed her no further, seeing her wretchedness
of spirit. But they walked with her to the car and
shook hands with her when she was in and urged her to
come again.</p>
<p>When she had disappeared in the aspens among
which the trail led, Mary said to her father:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said they killed a man named Dent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did. I saw the killing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And nothing was ever done about it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. Nobody but me knew of the happening and
I&rsquo;d of had a bullet through my heart if I&rsquo;d talked. I
might yet even now, so see that you keep your mouth
shut.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was mad, so mad I could say anything. But she
isn&rsquo;t the kind to repeat the story; I&rsquo;m not afraid on
that score. She&rsquo;s clean strain all through.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know the man whom Sorenson and the
others killed?&rdquo; Mary questioned, in some awe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew of him, but I was only a lad then. I saw it
all through the back door of Vorse&rsquo;s saloon where it
happened, but I&rsquo;ve never breathed about it to a soul. I
didn&rsquo;t want to be murdered some dark night. Those
four men would see that the job was done quick even
now, I&rsquo;m saying, if they were on to the fact. I know
&rsquo;em, if nobody else does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s skin crawled with prickles of fear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They must be awful bad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were devils then, and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114' name='page_114'></a>114</span>
changed to angels to-day, though they try to appear
decent. I know &rsquo;em; I know what they&rsquo;ll do once they
start. You can&rsquo;t make sheep out of wolves just by
giving &rsquo;em a fleece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said they robbed another man at the same time
they killed that Dent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; and it only goes to show the hellish crooks
they are. It was another man in the saloon. He was
drunk. They made him believe he had killed Dent.
Then said they&rsquo;d help him to get away if he gave them
his property. He was a rich fellow who had come out
from the east and gone to ranching, a tenderfoot.
They took his stuff and he skipped the country with his
wife. That was the last of him, and I reckon he believes
to this day that he&rsquo;s a murderer. And that&rsquo;s how
they got the start of their wealth, or a big part of it,
Sorenson and Vorse and the other two. They&rsquo;ve got
the San Mateo Cattle Company, with fifty thousand
head of steers, and ten or twenty bands of sheeps and
ranches, and the bank, and all the rest, and they walk
around like honest men. But they&rsquo;re thieves and murderers,
Mary, thieves and murderers! I&rsquo;d rather be
the man I am, poor and with nothing but this little
mortgaged piece of ground and my few cattle, than
them, who robbed Dent and killed him and then robbed
and drove out Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that the other man&rsquo;s name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny. The same as the man who brought
me home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are lots of Weirs, like the Johnsons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so many, I guess. Maybe they&rsquo;re related. Did
the man who skipped have any children?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115' name='page_115'></a>115</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No. None I ever heard of, though I didn&rsquo;t know
much about him. Just him and his wife, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson had perceived no resemblance between the
engineer and the vanished man of whom he spoke. As
for that, however, he had no clear recollection of the
elder Weir&rsquo;s face; he was but twelve years old at
the time of the dramatic event, thirty years before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, come along and eat,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;And remember!
Not a word of this to a soul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Janet Hosmer was driving slowly down
the canyon, oblivious that opportunity to unlock the
whole mystery had been hers, never dreaming that she
had just missed by the slenderest margin what Steele
Weir would have given the world to know.</p>
<p>For an instant Fate had placed the key in her hand.
She knew it not; it was withdrawn again and the door
remained closed and locked while the threads of Destiny
continued to be spun.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XII_THE_PLOT' id='CHAPTER_XII_THE_PLOT'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h3>THE PLOT</h3>
</div>
<p>In Vorse&rsquo;s saloon, where in the past so many evil
ideas for the acquisition of money or power had
sprouted, the scheme had its inception. It had been
of slow growth, with innumerable suggestions considered,
tested, discarded. The intended arrest and trial
of Weir had been the first aim; but this had expanded
until at last the plot had become of really magnificent
proportions, cunning yet daring, devilish enough even
to satisfy the hate and greed of its originators, consummate
in design, absolutely safe and conclusive.</p>
<p>It was Sorenson who conceived the notion of pulling
the irrigation project down in ruins at the moment of
Weir&rsquo;s own fall. Judge Gordon a few days later had
pieced out the method, which was either to corrupt the
workmen to wreck dam and camp or to place them in
the equivocal position of having done so apparently
though others did it in fact. Vorse and Burkhardt devised
the details. Weir should be left free until the
blow had fallen on the camp, whereupon he should be
immediately clapped into jail on the murder charge,
which, coming on top of the &ldquo;riot,&rdquo; would paralyze all
company action and work. From such a crushing
double-blow no concern could quickly recover, if indeed
the loss did not result in total cessation of construction.</p>
<p>Thus shedding their coats of expedient lawfulness,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117' name='page_117'></a>117</span>
they reverted under the menace of Steele Weir&rsquo;s presence
to the men they were in an earlier age&ndash;&ndash;an age
when a few white land and cattle &ldquo;barons&rdquo; dominated
the region, predatory, arrogant, masterful and despotic;
the age just ceasing when the elder Weir and
Dent arrived; the age of their youth forty years before,
the age when railroads and telegraphs and law were
remote, and chicanery and force were the common
agents, and &ldquo;guns&rdquo; the final arbiters.</p>
<p>To them Weir was like a reincarnated spirit of that
age. He guessed if he did not know their past. He
had appeared in order to challenge their supremacy,
end their rule, avenge his father&rsquo;s dispossession at their
hands. He instinctively and by nature was an enemy;
he would have been their enemy in any other place and
under any other circumstances. He was a head-hunter,
and in turn was to be hunted down. He was the kind
who neither made compromises nor asked quarter. He
veiled his purposes in as great secrecy as did they, and
when he struck it would be suddenly, fiercely, mercilessly&ndash;&ndash;if
he struck. They were determined he should
not strike, being himself first surprised and crushed, for
though in ignorance of what he could bring against
them their fears were real. Everything, indeed, about
the man antagonized them, alarmed them, stirred their
hate and filmed their eyes with blood. He must be
destroyed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And with him the dam,&rdquo; Sorenson had said. &ldquo;Both
together.&rdquo; For there was no effort to conceal among
themselves their savage intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll never come to trial,&rdquo; Vorse remarked, with a
malignant gleam in his blue eyes and a shutting of his
thin lips. &ldquo;An attempted jail delivery by &lsquo;friends&rsquo;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118' name='page_118'></a>118</span>
will fix that. All they will have to do then is to buy him
a pine box.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If the man had but stayed away!&rdquo; Judge Gordon
exclaimed. Cunning, not force, was his forte; and the
measures in prospect at times had oppressed him with
dreadful forebodings. He was growing old, feeble, and
here when he was entitled to peace he still had to fight
for his own.</p>
<p>In accordance with the scheme Burkhardt vanished
from San Mateo for a time, ostensibly on business but
in fact on a journey across the Mexican line, where he
conducted negotiations with a certain &ldquo;revolu&ccedil;ionista&rdquo;
of no particular notoriety as yet, of avaricious character,
unscrupulous nature, and with a small following
of fellow bandits and a large animosity for Americans.
His ambition was to emulate the brilliant Villa. But
pickings had been poor of late, no more than that of
stealing a few horses from across the border. To
Burkhardt, who had heard of him and sought him out,
he listened with interest and bargained with zest. Five
thousand in gold for fifty men was like pearls from
Paradise. And whatever this Yankee&rsquo;s own private
purpose, it was a chance for the chieftain to strike
secretly and safely at Americans, in addition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come through in squads after they&rsquo;ve
slipped across the line,&rdquo; Burkhardt reported. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
to pose as laborers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo; Sorenson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Along next week. They&rsquo;re to drop off down along
the railroad at different towns and I&rsquo;ll run them up
into the mountains with some grub. Then we&rsquo;ll assemble
them quietly a couple miles off from the dam,
where they&rsquo;ll be handy on the chosen night. Afterwards
we&rsquo;ll slip them back to the railroad, and they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119' name='page_119'></a>119</span>
fade into Mexico. Weir&rsquo;s workmen will be drunk and
rowing&ndash;&ndash;and will have done the job, eh?&rdquo; Burkhardt
shook with suppressed, evil laughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they&rsquo;re drunk, they may join in and help,&rdquo; Judge
Gordon stated, acutely. &ldquo;A mob full of whiskey will
do anything. If they did take a hand, it would round
out the case against them perfectly. Very likely next
day they, too, would fade, as you put it, Burkhardt;
they would want to get out of this part of country as
quickly as possible when they realized what had happened.
I see no flaw in our plan. Fortunately the
three directors who are coming will be gone by the end
of next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What directors?&rdquo; Burkhardt asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re to be here on an inspection trip, so they
wrote, and will be pleased to hear our complaints in
regard to the question of workmen.&rdquo; Gordon&rsquo;s tone
was ironical. &ldquo;I wrote them protesting Weir&rsquo;s discharge
of our people, you remember, but that was some
time ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the use of paying attention to the fools
now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We must carry out the farce, Burkhardt, for the
sake of appearances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to blow them up along with their dam!&rdquo; was
the scowling rejoinder, &ldquo;Well, let &rsquo;em inspect. Next
time they come back there won&rsquo;t be any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe we should arrest Weir before the thing&rsquo;s
pulled off,&rdquo; Gordon said, meditatively. &ldquo;It would be
surer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson set his heavy jaw.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I want him to see the wreck; I want him to
know just what&rsquo;s happened before he&rsquo;s haled away; I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120' name='page_120'></a>120</span>
want him feeling good and sick already when he gets
the next jolt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. It&rsquo;s him or us, as I&rsquo;ve said from the first;
and I&rsquo;ve always believed in making a clean sweep,&rdquo;
Vorse remarked. &ldquo;We have the right line this time.
First, make his men drunk and sore; then smash the
works; then arrest him quick; and last finish him off
with a bullet during a pretended jail delivery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be elements of danger in the last,&rdquo; Judge
Gordon stated, cautiously.</p>
<p>Vorse smiled and Burkhardt grinned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so you&rsquo;ll notice it,&rdquo; said the latter. &ldquo;The town
won&rsquo;t know anything about it until afterwards. Just a
few good men at night, masked and working fast, and
the thing is done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not feel easy till it&rsquo;s over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep up your nerve, Judge,&rdquo; Burkhardt grunted.
&ldquo;You used to be as lively as anybody when you were
young.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know, I know. But this Weir isn&rsquo;t going to stand
idle. If he ever gets a chance with his gun&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t get it,&rdquo; said Vorse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he&rsquo;ll not resist the sheriff when Madden arrests
him legally,&rdquo; Sorenson added. &ldquo;Nothing could
be better for us than if he did. He knows that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still I&rsquo;ll be glad when next week is past,&rdquo; the Judge
replied, with a sigh.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h3>THE CURRENT OF EVENTS</h3>
</div>
<p>Though outwardly the world&rsquo;s face was as calm as
ever, though peace seemed to bask on San Mateo and
the broad mesa and lofty mountain range, events were
rapidly shaping themselves to bring a thunder crash
of contending forces. Not Weir, not even the little
evil cabal plotting so desperately against him, guessed
the scope and power of the passions to be released.</p>
<p>As a vital impulse towards the climax, though an
unconscious one on her part so far as the general play
of circumstance was concerned, Janet Hosmer informed
Ed Sorenson of her determination to break
their engagement. This was the same evening she returned
from the Johnson ranch, when he called at her
telephoned request. He went to her home under the
impression that his box of candy and bundle of new
magazines had restored him to favor. He was very
jaunty, in fact, and bent on persuading her to name
an early day for their nuptials.</p>
<p>Imagine his wrath when she explained that she
wished to say that she could not marry him, at the
same time handing him his ring and the other trinkets
he had bestowed upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it because of our little spat last night about the
engineer?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;I apologized, Janet. I&rsquo;m
sorry still, and I love you above everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122' name='page_122'></a>122</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But I do, Janet. Above everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, not above yourself and your vices. You deceived
me for a long time, but now I know the truth.
You aroused my suspicions when you mentioned a Johnson
girl; there&rsquo;s only one Johnson girl hereabouts, as I
learned; and this noon I visited her and her father.
They informed me fully about your conduct towards
Mary at Bowenville and your promises to marry her&ndash;&ndash;that,
when you were engaged to me. There are other
things I heard to-day. Of affairs with Mexican girls
that are shameful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lies, lies!&rdquo; was the passionate disclaimer. &ldquo;Or if
I have been flirting a little, and never since my engagement,
it&rsquo;s no more than any fellow does.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can neither excuse nor justify your words and
actions towards Mary Johnson not a month ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re liars, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you confront them and say that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taken by surprise Sorenson hesitated, flushed, and
then made a gesture of disdain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not, because I&rsquo;ll not condescend to answer such
baseless charges,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I thought you had sense
enough not to believe every little thing you hear. Certainly
I expect you not to believe this, and I know you
won&rsquo;t on consideration. Then we&rsquo;ll be married. I came
here to-night to urge you to marry me soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry you, and we&rsquo;re no longer engaged.
You&rsquo;ve acted faithlessly and dishonorably. You&rsquo;re not
the decent man I thought you were.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you still love me, Janet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t think I ever loved you; I was loving a
man who didn&rsquo;t exist, an illusion I imagined to be Ed
Sorenson, not your real self. If I loved at all, which
I now doubt! And you never loved me, though you
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123' name='page_123'></a>123</span>
may think you did and still do. But it&rsquo;s not so; for no
man who really loved a respectable girl could at the
same time do what you did. Think of it! While pretending
to love me, you were secretly trying to inveigle
that poor ignorant girl away from home. You&rsquo;re not
a man; you&rsquo;re a beast. The shame and disgust and
humiliation I suffer at the thought of my position during
that time, your effort to hoodwink both Mary
Johnson and me, so fills me with anger I can&rsquo;t talk to
you. Go, go! And please don&rsquo;t even speak to me
hereafter, on the street or anywhere else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Instead of departing the man grasped her wrist and
gave her a venomous look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was this sneak of an engineer, after all, who
told you this lie and turned you against me,&rdquo; he
snarled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go. Mr. Weir said nothing. It was you
yourself who betrayed yourself, or I should not have
known as I do, thank heavens. Stop holding my
wrist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For an instant Sorenson wavered between whether
he should obey her command or strike her as his rage
prompted. A very devil of passion beating in his
breast urged him to show her her place, deal with her
as he would like to do and as she deserved&ndash;&ndash;throw
her down and drag her by the hair until she crawled
forward and clasped his knees in subjection. But the
look in her eyes cooled this half-insane, whiskey-inspired
desire.</p>
<p>He took his hand off her wrist, picked up his hat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t throw me down this way,&rdquo; he sneered.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to marry me just the same, whether you
think so or not. I have a voice in this engagement,
and you can&rsquo;t break your word and promise to me
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124' name='page_124'></a>124</span>
because it happens to strike your fancy. Not for a
single minute!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you were a gentleman and a decent man you
wouldn&rsquo;t say that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not either, by your judgment, so I do say it.
I say it again: you&rsquo;re going to marry me, willingly or
unwillingly. Now if after thinking it over, you want
to forget all this and go on as before, all right. If not,
our engagement still holds just the same. You may release
me, but I haven&rsquo;t released you. Remember that.
And keep away from that engineer if you know what&rsquo;s
best for you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a scowl he stalked out of the house, leaving a
very angry, very tremulous and very heart-sick girl.
The fellow was in truth not a man, she perceived, but a
creature so conscienceless and loathsome that she
seemed contaminated through and through by his
touch, his words, and their previous relations. How
grossly he had deceived her as to his real character!
What a horrible future as his wife she had escaped!
Nor was she yet free, for he promised to make an infinity
of trouble.</p>
<p>That day she could do nothing. Her father noting
her face asked what was the trouble, and she told him
the whole affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard rumors of late about him and was worried,&rdquo;
he said. &ldquo;You did the only thing, of course.
Pay no attention to his words; I&rsquo;ll see he doesn&rsquo;t annoy
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was three or four days afterwards that she called
Weir up at the dam in a desire to hear the voice of a
man she knew to be straight and upright.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve wondered if a girl is allowed to look at your
dam,&rdquo; she said on impulse, when they had chatted for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125' name='page_125'></a>125</span>
a moment. &ldquo;Father, who was at your camp to attend
an injured man, says you&rsquo;re making famous progress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be more than delighted to show you the work.
But&ndash;&ndash;I wonder&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let what people say disturb you,&rdquo; she replied
quickly, divining his thought. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve arranged all
that.&rdquo; A somewhat obscure remark to Weir.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then come any time&ndash;&ndash;and often. I hope to be able
to conduct you around, the first visit at least. Next
week I may not be able to do so as a committee of
directors arrive who&rsquo;ll take my time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; Janet answered, politely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A manager has to be directed occasionally, or he
may run wild,&rdquo; she heard, with his laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come before they do,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Quite as she had announced she did run up to the
canyon and go with Weir over the hillsides and dam,
asking questions and displaying a great interest in the
men and the operation of the machinery. The concrete
work was nearing an end. Already tracks were
laid for the dump trams that were to carry dirt from
steam-shovels to the dam to form its main body.</p>
<p>She perceived the immense labor of the project and
the co&ouml;rdinated effort required. The necessity in itself
of dragging hither from Bowenville all of the supplies,
the material, the huge machines, was overwhelming.
The responsibility of combining scientific knowledge
and raw industry to an exact result struck her as
prodigious. The handling of hundreds of subordinate
workmen and assistants of various grades and skill demanded
exceptional ability, understanding, will and
generalship. Yet these things the man at her side,
Steele Weir, accomplished and supplied; and appeared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_126' name='page_126'></a>126</span>
quite calm and unmoved about it, as if it was all a matter
of course.</p>
<p>She glanced at the ground, flushing. The thought
of Ed Sorenson, making only a pretense of doing anything
useful and because his father was rich doing
nothing in reality but waste himself in vicious practices,
was in her mind. What must have the engineer
believed of her all this while when he knew Sorenson&rsquo;s
true nature and infamous record? Did he suppose her
a light-headed feather, indifferent to everything except
that her husband should be rich? Very likely. There
were plenty of girls of that type. He naturally would
suppose her one.</p>
<p>And she could say nothing to put herself in a better
light and to gain his respect&ndash;&ndash;for that she now desired
greatly. She saw him as he was, a big man, a strong
man, a man whose respect was to be prized. Beside
him she felt herself small and ordinary. That was all
right, but she was determined he should not believe
her insignificant, shallow, unworthy, mercenary.</p>
<p>While she could not explain matters openly without
shaming herself and still lowering herself in his
estimation, he being only an acquaintance, yet there
were ways of getting at the end. Janet could act
adroitly, like most women, when it best served the purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know, I just learned from friends of yours
on Terry Creek that you&rsquo;re a public benefactor as well
as an engineer,&rdquo; she stated, when they paused on the
hillside for a last look at the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>His eyes came around and found hers fixed on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I happened to stop at the Johnson ranch. They
didn&rsquo;t say so, but I know they would be pleased to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127' name='page_127'></a>127</span>
death if you would go to dinner there some day. They
have some fine fat chickens, if you like chicken fried
or baked, and they hesitate to ask you only because
they&rsquo;re afraid you&rsquo;ll refuse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fried chicken is my weakness. Of course I&rsquo;ll go;
at the first spare chance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But all the while Steele Weir&rsquo;s mind was eddying
with wonderment. He had colored at mention of the
Johnson ranch, as if he had been caught with a hand in
a jam pot. And it meant only one thing: she knew of
the Bowenville episode. Involuntarily his eyes flashed
to her left hand with which she was brushing back the
hair under her hat brim. There was no diamond solitaire
on its third finger. Surely, something had happened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I must be returning home. I just thought I&rsquo;d
give you a tiny hint,&rdquo; said she. An odd smile rested
on her lips as she spoke, for hints may carry multiple
suggestions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; Weir said suddenly.</p>
<p>Man of action though she knew him to be, she never
anticipated he would or could act so directly. He
reached out and seized her left hand and scanned it
significantly. Then he raised his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; he asked, tapping the finger
with one of his own. &ldquo;Does this mean&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was Janet&rsquo;s turn to become scarlet. She tried
to smile again, but it was a wavering smile that appeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does what mean?&rdquo; she fenced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&ndash;&ndash;well, that the ring is off permanently?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And that there&rsquo;s now a chance for me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s eyes at that popped open very wide indeed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128' name='page_128'></a>128</span>
Meanwhile Weir still held to the palm resting in
his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You?&rdquo; she breathed, faintly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me, yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Presently with a gentle movement she drew her hand
free. She had been quite dumbfounded, but not so
dumbfounded that she did not realize that this new situation
had requirements of its own. He appeared absolutely
sincere and resolute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I never dreamed of such a thing!&rdquo; she stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nor I&ndash;&ndash;because until now I hadn&rsquo;t the right. All
I ask is that you give me your friendship&ndash;&ndash;and a
chance&ndash;&ndash;and&ndash;&ndash;well, we&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no reason why we shouldn&rsquo;t be friends,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;We are already, aren&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;now. I never actually thought so before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things have changed,&rdquo; she stated. And her lips
closed with a firm pressure as she spoke. &ldquo;Or I
shouldn&rsquo;t have been here inspecting the dam, should
I?&rdquo; Again the smile flashed upon her face. &ldquo;You may
consider this a preliminary inspection to that of your
high and mighty directors, and I assure you my verdict&ndash;&ndash;is
that the word?&ndash;&ndash;is favorable. Now I must be
going to the car. Father likes his meals on time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And when shall I see you again?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The note of eagerness in his voice set her heart
moving a bit faster. If he carried on his engineering
work as he did his friendship, no wonder he got things
done.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, when you wish to call, Mr. Weir. Both
father and I shall be pleased to have you come any
time.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129' name='page_129'></a>129</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll certainly avail myself of the privilege,&rdquo; said
he. &ldquo;You must really go now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a feeling of exaltation at this new turn of
affairs he watched her drive away from camp, a feeling
that persisted during the succeeding days.</p>
<p>The three directors arrived. That was Thursday
evening; and Friday and Saturday were devoted to a
discussion of construction plans, inspection of the
works, analysis of costs and so on. Weir found the
men what he expected: quick to comprehend facts, incisive
of mind, and though of course not engineers yet
able to measure results; while they on their part were
appreciative of the exceptional progress made and of
his thorough command of the project. They knew
the first hour that the right manager was in charge
at last.</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon Sorenson and Judge Gordon
called at headquarters, by appointment, to discuss the
grievance held locally against the company. Weir was
present at the meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to whether the Mexican workmen who were discharged
were actually giving a full return in work for
the wages, as you maintain, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Pollock,
one of the directors and a corporation lawyer
from New York, in reply to the visitors&rsquo; statement,
&ldquo;that is a question not of opinion but of fact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fact, yes,&rdquo; Judge Gordon argued. &ldquo;Fact supported
by the evidence of the three hundred workmen
against that of a single man, your manager, who
had just come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are not your three hundred men prejudiced witnesses?&rdquo;
the New Yorker inquired, a slight smile upon
his thin face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more than is Mr. Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130' name='page_130'></a>130</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Weir is the manager and consequently has
the power of decision in such matters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to the extent of revoking unfairly your promise,
given orally, to be sure, but still given, to employ
local labor.&rdquo; Sorenson was the speaker and his heavy
face wore an expression of ill-disguised contempt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agreed. Local labor was to be hired,&rdquo; said Pollock.
&ldquo;But our company isn&rsquo;t a philanthropic institution;
it&rsquo;s run on strictly business principles. Any
agreement we made implied that local workmen should
give exactly what other workmen would give in work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did so,&rdquo; Judge Gordon affirmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no trouble until this man came,&rdquo; Sorenson
remarked. &ldquo;I suppose he felt that he had to show
his authority.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but there was if not trouble at any rate dissatisfaction
on our part,&rdquo; Pollock stated, tapping a
finger on the table. &ldquo;Construction wasn&rsquo;t progressing
as we knew it should, which was the very reason for
getting a new manager, one who could speed it up.
But as I said, it all comes down to a question of fact.
You gentlemen offer your workmen&rsquo;s avowals of industry
to support your claim; Mr. Weir, on the other
hand, gives us some definite records to back up his side.
Here they are for the last week the workmen from San
Mateo and neighborhood worked&ndash;&ndash;his first week here;
and for the succeeding weeks under the men shipped in;
in material used, in cubic yards of concrete construction,
and in percentage of work finished. Examine
them if you please. They show daily and weekly results
to be just a trifle less than double for the corresponding
time the imported workmen have been here.
In other words, the new men have, while shortening the
time of completion, given twice as much work for exactly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131' name='page_131'></a>131</span>
the same wage paid your Mexicans. In other words,
too, your local laborers cancelled our agreement by
their own incompetence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your manager could easily have doctored those records,&rdquo;
Sorenson stated, coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You scarcely mean that, sir,&rdquo; Pollock instantly replied
icily, his amiability vanishing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, Judge, we may as well go, I think. We&rsquo;re
appealing to a prejudiced court.&rdquo; And Sorenson
arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our decision to view the matter like Mr. Weir is because
his position is sustained by these facts, not because
we&rsquo;re prejudiced, as you insinuate. But I may
add that it would not be strange if we were prejudiced,
as we&rsquo;ve become convinced that you gentlemen haven&rsquo;t
been sincere in your attitude towards our company and
if anything are strongly hostile. Any one may be deceived
for a time, and we were, but not permanently.
You would have done much better to have recognized
that we have a perfect right to build this project on
land that we bought and with water that we acquired.
For it will be built in any case and in spite of such
local opposition as may be made.&rdquo; Pollock flicked the
ash from his cigar with a careful finger. &ldquo;That is a
mere piece of information or a declaration of war,
whichever way you wish to take it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you we were wasting our time coming here,&rdquo;
the cattleman said to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good day, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Judge Gordon, politely.</p>
<p>And the pair went out to Sorenson&rsquo;s machine.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the two other directors left to catch
a train at Bowenville, Pollock planning to stay with
Weir to formulate a report during the next day or two
for presentation to the entire directorate at its next
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132' name='page_132'></a>132</span>
meeting. Sorenson caught a glimpse of the car whirling
through town, with Weir at the wheel, who with
Pollock accompanied the departing men that certain
unsettled points might be discussed up to the last moment.</p>
<p>As Weir and Pollock were returning, the latter eyed
the engineer and laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve evidently brushed these fellows&rsquo;, Sorenson&rsquo;s
and Gordon&rsquo;s, fur the wrong way to please them. But
they&rsquo;ll probably leave us alone from now on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll not leave me alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eh? How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I have, as it happens, a little trouble with
them on my own hook. A private matter antedating
the building of the dam. They&rsquo;re after me. I had to
put a piece of lead into a fellow who tried to kill me
from the dark one night. I speak of it in case you
should be told and wonder; otherwise I should not have
mentioned the thing. I&rsquo;m not popular in San Mateo,
in consequence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, I had heard nothing of that. It interests me.
You were not touched.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hat, that was all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very interesting, very interesting, indeed,&rdquo; was
Pollock&rsquo;s only comment. But if his tone was casual,
his eyes were busy in sidelong study of the engineer,
making a new appraisal and drawing fresh conclusions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile several knots were being tied in the web
of circumstance. Sorenson took his telephone and conversed
briefly with Vorse, passing the information that
he had just seen the three directors leaving for the east.
So they were out of the way. In reply the saloon-keeper
stated that he would start the whisky end of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133' name='page_133'></a>133</span>
game that evening. By the morrow, Sunday, when the
camp was at rest, the workmen would all be &ldquo;celebrating.&rdquo;
Burkhardt had reported the last load of &ldquo;southern
cattle&rdquo; shipped in and driven on the range the
previous evening&ndash;&ndash;a seemingly innocent statement that
Sorenson understood perfectly. Up in the hills, safely
hidden in the timber, lay the fifty men brought from
Mexico to make the assault on the dam the next night,
men whose instruments of destruction would be fire and
dynamite. Twenty-four hours more would bring the
moment of action.</p>
<p>Ignorant of all this Ed Sorenson had been forming a
little individual scheme that would promote his own
affairs, chief of which was to win Janet Hosmer. Drinking
heavily ever since his rebuff, he had sunk into a condition
of evil determination and recklessness that made
him fit for any desperate act. After much meditation
fed by whisky, he had evolved a plan that would bring
him success. Thereupon he had loaded his car with a
quantity of selected stuff and made a mysterious journey
at night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll learn I meant business,&rdquo; was his frequent soliloquy.</p>
<p>And while these strands were being knit into the skein
Martinez was producing another. Quietly, carefully,
persuasively, he had been pursuing his own particular
course of eliciting history for use in his &ldquo;Chronicle,&rdquo; as
he named it,&ndash;&ndash;and for another use concerning which he
was as still as death.</p>
<p>That he was successful in obtaining what he had been
after was made known to Weir about dusk that evening
while he was talking with Pollock in his office. But that
he had not been so lucky in covering his tracks was likewise
apparent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134' name='page_134'></a>134</span></div>
<p>The telephone rang. Steele took down the receiver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Janet Hosmer at once,&rdquo; Felipe Martinez&rsquo; terrified
voice came over the wire. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll have it, the paper&ndash;&ndash;the
one you want. They&rsquo;ve learned I got it; they&rsquo;re
after me now. Hammering on the door. If you don&rsquo;t
hurry&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His words ceased abruptly in an anguished quaver.
At the same time Weir heard carried to him the sound
of a crash as of a door smashed. Excusing himself hurriedly,
Steele Weir seized his holster from a nail and
buckled on the belt. Then snatching his hat, he ran
outside the building to his car.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, who is he gunning for?&rdquo; Pollock asked himself
aloud, &ldquo;I rather wish he had invited me along.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But neither he nor Weir himself, nor any soul in San
Mateo, knew that at last the furious torrent of events
had burst upon the community. Weir sensed something.
But Sorenson brooding on the morrow thought the moment
had not yet come. His son was occupied with his
own treacherous scheme. Even Vorse and Burkhardt
smashing their way into Martinez&rsquo; office saw nothing
beyond the immediate necessity. Yet the flood was
bearing down on all.</p>

<a name='CHAPTER_XIV_OLD_SAUREZ_DEPOSITION' id='CHAPTER_XIV_OLD_SAUREZ_DEPOSITION'></a>
<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h3>OLD SAUREZ&rsquo; DEPOSITION</h3>
</div>
<p>In order to understand why Vorse and Burkhardt
were attacking Martinez&rsquo; office it is necessary to trace the
lawyer&rsquo;s movements and the incidents which precipitated
that act. Martinez had, as stated, not been idle. Following
the clue obtained from the woman who had worked
in the elder Weir&rsquo;s household, he visited the old Mexican
named as having been used as roustabout by Vorse in
early days. This was old Saurez, whom he knew. The
wrinkled old fellow seldom came to town now, spending
most of the time sitting against the sunny side of his
son&rsquo;s house on Pina Creek, twenty miles south, where
he lived.</p>
<p>Martinez in the ten days that had elapsed since informing
Weir he had learned of Saurez&rsquo; possible knowledge
of the past had proceeded to make himself agreeable
to the gray-headed old man. He had explained his
&ldquo;history.&rdquo; He exercised all the arts of graciousness and
flattery. Beginning at the present he worked back
through the past to the killing of Jim Dent and the
flight of Joseph Weir, extracting tales of early fights,
raids, accidents, big storms, violent deaths and killings,
making elaborate notes, winning the narrator&rsquo;s confidence
and gradually drawing forth the facts he really
sought.</p>
<p>Out of all the rambling talk and vague accounts of the
Dent and Weir affair Martinez was able to piece together
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136' name='page_136'></a>136</span>
the fragments in a clear statement. This was
that Saurez had seen Weir and Dent in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon.
The pair had gambled for a time with Vorse, Burkhardt
(at that time sheriff), Sorenson and Judge Gordon.
After losing for a time Weir refused to continue in the
poker game, although he was drunk. Dent played on
notwithstanding Weir&rsquo;s urgence to desist; he had already
lost all his money and began staking his cattle
and finally his ranch. At this stage Weir had gone to
sleep at another table, with his head on his arms. Vorse
had locked the front door to keep out visitors during
the big game. But the back door remained open for
air.</p>
<p>Saurez had busied himself cleaning the bar. All at
once he saw the players spring up in their game, Dent
talking angrily about cheating, marked cards and so
on. Then the guns came out when he pointed at a card
that was marked&ndash;&ndash;for it had been marked with pinpricks
as Saurez saw later on examining the deck, which
Dent had perceived in spite of the whisky in him. And
Sorenson and Vorse had both shot him where he stood.
Yes, shootings were not uncommon. Every one but he,
Saurez, had likely forgotten all about the matter. That
was long ago.</p>
<p>Afterwards Vorse had sent the Mexican away for
something or other, with an injunction to keep his mouth
closed. As said, speaking of it now made no difference,
though he expected Martinez to keep his promise to publish
none of the stories while he was still alive; that was
agreed. When the Mexican had left the saloon Weir
was yet sleeping, having only raised his head at the
pistol shots to stare drunkenly and then relapse. What
occurred afterwards Saurez did not know. Weir left
the country. Dent was buried, the story being told
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137' name='page_137'></a>137</span>
that he had committed suicide. Every one believed it:
had he not lost his ranch at poker? That was the end
of the business. Other affairs happened and it was forgotten.</p>
<p>On this Saturday Martinez had persuaded Saurez to
accompany him to San Mateo. It would be necessary
to sign the stories, he explained lightly, to give them
proper weight and in order that when the book was published
after Saurez&rsquo; death they would be seen to be true
accounts, with Saurez&rsquo; picture that a photographer
would make appearing in the middle. He, Saurez, would
be famous, and his sons and grandsons would have copies
of the book in their houses to show visitors and the
priest. Ah, it would be well to have the priest witness
Saurez&rsquo; signature, then sceptical people would know indeed
that the stories were Saurez&rsquo; own accounts. So on
and so on.</p>
<p>The matter required infinite precautions, patience,
skill on the lawyer&rsquo;s part. He had prepared two or
three dozen depositions of events, as a husk for the real
kernel. With Saurez in his office at last he telephoned
the priest to call at once and unostentatiously caught
on the street four other Mexicans of the better class,
bringing them in. When the priest arrived he closed
the door and explained his desire they should act as
witnesses to Saurez&rsquo; statements. He had already solicited
the <i>padre&rsquo;s</i> advice as to the history; the others all had
heard of it; he gave them a number of the most harmless
depositions to read; and set Saurez to work making
his mark on the rest of the papers. During the reading
and the accompanying lively discussion of the witnesses,
he had them pause to witness Saurez&rsquo; mark with their
own names in the places provided. About the tenth deposition
when their attention was confused and flagging
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138' name='page_138'></a>138</span>
he slipped the account concerning Weir and Dent, a
many-paged attestation, upon the table, so folded that
nothing but the signing space was visible. It was the
critical instant for Martinez; his thin body was more
nervous than ever, his eyes brighter and more restless.
But at last the ordeal was over.</p>
<p>Saurez&rsquo; heavy black cross was at the bottom of the
important deposition, the priest and the other four
men had appended their names, and all that remained
to do was for Martinez to fill out the acknowledgment
and affix his seal. He whisked the document behind his
back and called attention to a humorous episode in a
paper one of the men still held, starting a laugh. Then
he suggested they rest and opened a bottle of wine, over
which the others congratulated Saurez and Martinez
and predicted a wonderful fame for the &ldquo;Chronicle.&rdquo;
Finally the lawyer perceived, as he said, that Saurez
was weary. Anyway, it was supper-time. The remaining
papers could be signed another day.</p>
<p>The witnesses departed, much pleased with the affair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walk up and down outside for a little time while I
straighten the sheets, then we&rsquo;ll go eat and afterwards
I&rsquo;ll drive you home to bed,&rdquo; the attorney said. &ldquo;The
fresh air will give you an appetite. Behold, you&rsquo;re already
becoming a famous man! I shall preserve these
documents safely as they are tremendously important
to our town, our state, our country!&rdquo; And a grandiloquent
gesture accompanied the words. &ldquo;Come back in
a little while, my friend, then we&rsquo;ll see how much food
you can hide away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Saurez much gratified at these words and at everything
went out slowly, for he was troubled by rheumatism.
The instant his back disappeared Martinez sprang
to the table, swiftly filled out the acknowledgment of the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139' name='page_139'></a>139</span>
old man&rsquo;s signature to the Weir document, clapped the
page under the seal and pressed home the stamp. Then
pushing the folded statement into an envelope and that
into his pocket, he leaned back with a sigh of exhaustion.
The thing was accomplished at last, but the strain had
been great. Weir&rsquo;s command to secure evidence had
been obeyed. Only the promise to await Saurez&rsquo; death,
troubled Martinez, and with a convenient sophistry he
decided that an agreement not to print the narrative
in a book did not extend to using it in court. Weir
would be delighted&ndash;&ndash;it was a famous coup.</p>
<p>How long Martinez sat reveling in this well-earned
satisfaction he was unaware, until with a start he glanced
at his watch. Three-quarters of an hour had passed.
He went out to look for Saurez. But he was not in sight
and though several persons had seen him they could
not say where he had gone. Martinez went again into
his office. When another half-hour had drifted by he
decided the old man had encountered friends and either
caught a ride home or gone with one to supper. So
Martinez proceeded to his own meal.</p>
<p>Yet he was pervaded by an unaccountable uneasiness.
The sun had set in a bank of clouds and night was not
far off. He made another search for the old Mexican,
inquiring here and there, until he was informed by one
that he had seen Saurez in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon talking with
Vorse and sipping a glass of brandy. That was half
an hour before. A chill of fear spread over the lawyer&rsquo;s
skin.</p>
<p>Determined, however, to learn the worst, he stole to
the saloon and peered over the slatted door. The Mexican
bar-keeper was wiping a glass; Vorse was not in
sight; and&ndash;&ndash;ha! there was Saurez himself drowsing by a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140' name='page_140'></a>140</span>
table. Martinez slipped in and made his way to the
rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come; time to go home,&rdquo; he said softly, giving the
old Mexican&rsquo;s shoulder a shake. This did not arouse
the sleeper, so he added force to his hand, at which the
other sagged forward limply.</p>
<p>Martinez jumped back. Next he stood quite still,
staring. Then he approached and lifting the drooping
head, gazed at the wrinkled face and glazed eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miguel, come here!&rdquo; he exclaimed, anxiously.
&ldquo;Saurez is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead!&rdquo; The bar-keeper ran to the spot, eyes large
with alarm and excitement. &ldquo;Dios, I thought him
asleep! See, there is the glass in which I gave him
brandy at Se&ntilde;or Vorse&rsquo;s order. The old one said he
had come in to pay a little visit to his old employer
and have a chat. They talked for some time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was Vorse asking him questions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. I think Saurez was telling him how he happened
to be in town. I paid little attention to them,
however. After a while I glanced up and saw Vorse
standing by him. They were not talking. Then Vorse
came away and said the old man had fallen asleep, and
he went out to supper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez again lifted the head and darted glances
over the dead man&rsquo;s breast. There were no wounds, but
on the shriveled brown throat he saw what might have
been a thumb-mark. He could not be sure, yet that was
his guess.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was an old man,&rdquo; Miguel remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. You should notify his son and also the undertaker,
so the body can be taken care of. I&rsquo;ll telephone
the latter too when I reach my office.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This Martinez did, informing Saurez&rsquo;s family that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141' name='page_141'></a>141</span>
the old man had died while apparently asleep at Vorse&rsquo;s,
and expressed his sympathy and sorrow.</p>
<p>One feature of the case he instantly perceived; he
was released from any obligation to keep silent regarding
the old man&rsquo;s declaration. Fortunate was he to
have obtained it before Vorse had got wind of his purpose.
At the thought of Vorse he arose and locked
both front and back doors of the building, pulled down
the window shades and turned out the light.</p>
<p>It was almost dark by now. In the darkness he felt
safer. Any one passing would suppose him away. Perhaps
he should spend the night elsewhere&ndash;&ndash;at the dam,
for instance. Again the same shudder shook his frame
that he had experienced on seeing the mark on Saurez&rsquo;
throat. Vorse had killed the old Mexican, of that he
was convinced. With his tongue made garrulous by
brandy and by the presence of his old employer the old
man had doubtless related everything that occurred
between him and Martinez; and the vulture-like, bald-headed
saloon-keeper, recognizing that he had been unconsciously
betrayed had immediately acted to close
this witness&rsquo; lips forever against a second utterance.</p>
<p>Martinez himself was in danger. The perspiration
dampened his face as he realized that as far as he was
concerned the die was cast. He must fling in his fortunes
with Weir to the utmost. He would first stand in
defense on his right as a lawyer to secure evidence for
a client, but if this failed&ndash;&ndash;and what rights would Vorse
halt for?&ndash;&ndash;he must depend upon the paper. Once they
had that, they would speedily put him out of the way as
they had done Saurez. But if they had it not, they
would at least hesitate to wreak their vengeance until
they could get it into their possession. He must place
it in Weir&rsquo;s hands at once, then if questioned refuse to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142' name='page_142'></a>142</span>
inform them of its whereabouts. Perhaps they would
try to seize it some time this night. He stood up, lighted
the lamp, saw that all was well in the office and took his
hat.</p>
<p>A peremptory knock sounded on the door of the rear
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up there, Martinez,&rdquo; a voice commanded.</p>
<p>He stole thither, listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who is it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind. Open this door or I&rsquo;ll pull it down,&rdquo;
came in hoarse tones he recognized as Burkhardt&rsquo;s. The
man, or men, outside had chosen the rear to force an entrance
if necessary, where there would be no spectators.
&ldquo;Jerk it open quick,&rdquo; Burkhardt continued savagely.
&ldquo;We want you.&rdquo; Then again, &ldquo;We knew you were
there, though you kept the place dark. Move lively before
I use this ax.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Never did Martinez&rsquo; mind work more rapidly. Likewise
his eyes darted everywhere in search of the object
he needed. Then he glided to a decrepit arm-chair and
turning it over stuffed the document in a rent in its
padded seat, out of sight underneath. Next he filled his
pockets with other papers signed by Saurez. Last, he
hastily tore open the little telephone book and ran a
forefinger down the H&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doctor Hosmer&rsquo;s, hurry,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Number F28.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blows were already sounding on the rear door, but
the lock was strong and resisted. Of all the persons he
knew Janet Hosmer was the only one he could trust to
keep her word. And he dare not wait until Weir could
come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this you, Janet? Martinez talking,&rdquo; he said, when
he heard her answer. &ldquo;Listen. I&rsquo;m at my office; men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143' name='page_143'></a>143</span>
are trying to break in to get a paper valuable for Mr.
Weir&rsquo;s defense. They must not get it. He&rsquo;s to be arrested
and tried for murder of the man he killed. You
and I know he&rsquo;s innocent. This is a life and death
matter. The paper is hidden in the old chair. The men
are breaking down the door. I&rsquo;ll get them away long
enough for you to come and obtain it. Give it to Weir&ndash;&ndash;at
once, to-night, immediately. Promise me you will,
promise! My own life probably hangs on it. Return
to your house and stay for half an hour and if he hasn&rsquo;t
arrived by that time, go to the dam. Thank you, thank
you&ndash;&ndash;from my heart! Start now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words had tumbled out in an agitated stream,
occupying but a few seconds. The panels were splintering
in the door now, as the ax smashed a way through.
Martinez had no need to look up Weir&rsquo;s number; and it
was in a strain of terror and excitement that he waited
for the connection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Janet Hosmer at once,&rdquo; he shot at the engineer,
followed by the rest of the warning already quoted which
had so electrifying an effect upon Steele Weir.</p>
<p>But the words had broken off abruptly. For as the
door crashed off its hinges Martinez dropped the telephone
receiver and darted for the front entrance, shooting
back the bolt and flinging it open. He almost
plunged into Vorse who was on guard there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand still,&rdquo; the man ordered. And Martinez kept
the spot as if congealed, for in the saloon-keeper&rsquo;s hand
was a revolver with an exceedingly large muzzle.</p>
<p>Burkhardt burst in, ax still in hand, eyes bloodshot
with rage. Vorse turned and closed the front door.
Then he glanced over the lawyer&rsquo;s table and ran a hand
into his inside coat pocket bulging with documents. He
glanced through one or two.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144' name='page_144'></a>144</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re after,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll take him
to my place where we can quietly settle the matter.&rdquo;
His eyes rested on the Mexican with ominous meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come along, you snake,&rdquo; Burkhardt growled, seizing
their prisoner&rsquo;s arm. &ldquo;Out the back way&ndash;&ndash;and keep
your mouth shut. Don&rsquo;t try to make a break of any
kind, if you know what&rsquo;s best for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez&rsquo; yellow skin was almost white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, gentlemen, what does this all mean?&rdquo; he began,
endeavoring to pull back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll learn soon enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step right along,&rdquo; Vorse added. &ldquo;Take him away,
Burkhardt, then I&rsquo;ll blow out this light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With no further word Martinez accompanied his captors
into the gloom of the night. They moved in silence
through the dark space behind the row of store buildings.
The lawyer felt that at least the way was clear
for Janet Hosmer.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h3>THE MASK DROPPED</h3>
</div>
<p>When Janet Hosmer, startled by Felipe Martinez&rsquo;
agitated appeal, turned from the telephone, her single
thought was to carry out on the instant his fervid injunction.
Something aimed at the engineer and the
lawyer was in movement, a plot for the former&rsquo;s arrest
and the destruction of evidence necessary to his defense,
according to Martinez&rsquo; quick hurried words; and the
Mexican now sought her aid, as she was the only one
within reach whom he could trust. That he must call
to her showed the desperate nature of the exigency&ndash;&ndash;and
he had said lives were at stake!</p>
<p>Haste was the imperative need. As her father was
absent, she summoned the Mexican girl from the kitchen,
for instinct advised the wisdom of having a companion
on this errand; and the two of them, bare-headed and
walking fast, set out for the house. Dusk was just
thickening to night. No stars were visible. A warm
moistness in the air forewarned of rain from the blanket
of clouds that had spread at sunset along the peaks.
Indeed, a few fine globules of water touched their faces
as they came into the main street and hurried along.</p>
<p>Neither girl had observed the automobile, unlighted
and moving slowly, that approached the Hosmer house
as they emerged. Apparently the driver perceiving them
against the lamplight of the doorway and noting their
departure thought better of bringing the car to a halt,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146' name='page_146'></a>146</span>
for he kept the machine in motion and as quietly as
possible trailed the pair by glimpses of their figures
flitting before an occasional illuminated window. When
Janet and her companion turned into the main street
where the stores were lighted his task became easier.</p>
<p>The street was peaceful. Janet saw no evidence of
the violence or danger indicated by the Mexican lawyer&rsquo;s
declaration, but she was too sensible to imagine on that
account that peril did not exist. The town was not
aware of what had occurred, that was all,&ndash;&ndash;not yet.
The chief actors in the conspiracy were still moving
stealthily against their intended victims; they had
pounced on Martinez and once they had seized the evidence
they sought they would arrest Weir. Afterwards
the people, as she guessed the matter, would be aroused
to create a strong sentiment against the helpless men.
It was an atrocious business.</p>
<p>But as yet things were in a lull&ndash;&ndash;and it was during
this pause, brief, critical, that Martinez expected her
to act. That much she had grasped from his hurried
words. She reached his office and halted to listen. No
gleam came from the building, nor from the low structure
on either side, and across the way all was dark&ndash;&ndash;dark
as it had been that night when the assassin&rsquo;s shot
had been fired at Steele Weir. Repressing a shudder,
she bade the Mexican girl follow her, groped for the
door knob, found it and pushed the door open.</p>
<p>Martinez had spoken of men forcing an entrance, so
it must have been at the rear. Inside all was pitchy
black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juanita, you have a match in your pocket, haven&rsquo;t
you?&rdquo; she demanded, anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Miss Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strike it, then.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147' name='page_147'></a>147</span></div>
<p>In the pent stillness of the dark office Janet could
hear the Mexican girl fumbling in the pocket of her
gingham dress. There came a scratching sound and a
tiny flame.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful of it,&rdquo; she warned. &ldquo;Now give it to me.
And close the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet lighted the smoky lamp resting on the table,
next took it up in her hand. A few papers had fallen
upon the floor. The room was still strong with fresh
cigarette smoke. Martinez could not have been gone
more than five minutes.</p>
<p>And in another five minutes&rsquo; time too Martinez&rsquo; captors
might be back again!</p>
<p>Holding the lamp aloft she peered about for an old
chair, her heart beating rapidly, her lips compressed.
But all the chairs, the three or four in the room, were
old. Her eyes encountered the Mexican girl staring
open-mouthed and scared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the lamp and keep by me,&rdquo; Janet ordered.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t upset it. What are you shaking for, you
ninny?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t help it&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re so white,&rdquo; the other
whimpered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never you mind me; do as I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet swiftly went from one chair to another, turning
them about, upside down, all ways. No paper was
hidden in or under any one of them, or indeed was there
space capable of holding a document. At last she gave
up, gazing about in dismay, dread, tears of vexation
and anxiety almost rising to her lids. Only one conclusion
was to be drawn: the men who had seized the lawyer
had found the paper in spite of his precaution.</p>
<p>She examined the chairs a second time feverishly, for
time was flying.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148' name='page_148'></a>148</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t find it, Juanita, the paper he telephoned me
to come and get,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s in there where he sleeps.&rdquo; And the Mexican
girl pointed at the inner door standing barely ajar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet led the way within. There was Martinez&rsquo; living- and
sleeping-room. The furnishings comprised a
bed, an old scratched bureau, a stand with wash-bowl,
a red and black Navajo blanket on the floor, a trunk,
a stool and a dilapidated stuffed chair&ndash;&ndash;just such a
chair as a paper could be hidden in. That into this
room the lawyer&rsquo;s assailants had burst their way was
apparent from the splintered door hanging from one
hinge at the rear.</p>
<p>Beckoning Juanita to bring the lamp, Janet ran to
the arm-chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, here it is!&rdquo; she cried, when she had turned the
piece of furniture over and inserted her hand in the
rent. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t found, after all! Come away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relief and exultation replaced her depression of the
moment before. She had succeeded; she had helped the
lawyer outwit his enemies; she must now return home to
await Steele Weir&rsquo;s arrival, or if he failed in that then
go to the dam.</p>
<p>In the outer room she bade the Mexican girl place the
lamp on the table once more and blow it out. This
was done. They groped forward to the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me out quietly, Juanita,&rdquo; Janet said. &ldquo;Only
Mr. Martinez knows we&rsquo;ve been here, and Mr. Weir, the
engineer. See, I&rsquo;m trusting you. This is a very important
paper for Mr. Weir, and other men are trying
to keep it out of his hands. So you must say nothing
to any one about our being here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Juanita assented in a whisper. Janet thereupon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149' name='page_149'></a>149</span>
opened the door and the pair stepped forth. A faint
hissing sound directly before them startled both.
But the American girl immediately recognized it for
what it was, the faint murmur of an automobile
engine.</p>
<p>She quietly closed the office door, caught her companion&rsquo;s
arm to lead her away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk,&rdquo; she whispered in her ear.</p>
<p>At the same instant the beam of an electric hand torch
flashed in their eyes, blinding them. Then as quickly
the light was extinguished and a heavy blanket was flung
over Janet&rsquo;s head. Her cry was choked off, but not that
of the Mexican girl who had been struck by the corner
of the cloth and who heard her mistress struggling in
the arms of the man who had seized her. The sound
of the struggle moved towards the car and then Juanita,
paralyzed by fright, was stunned by a sudden roar of
the exhaust, a grind of gears, and a rush in the darkness.
The automobile had gone, carrying off Janet Hosmer
a muffled prisoner. Juanita regaining use of her
legs fled for Doctor Hosmer&rsquo;s unmindful of the mist
against her face.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s sensation had been that of strangulation and
terror. In the thick folds of the blanket, held and lifted
by strong arms, all she could offer in the way of resistance
was futile kicks. She had been jammed into the
automobile seat and firmly kept there by an embrace
while the car was being started, which did not relax as
the machine gathered speed. For some minutes this
lasted, while she strained painfully for breath, and then
she perceived the car was stopping.</p>
<p>Her terror increased. What now would happen?
These men after overpowering Felipe Martinez had abducted
her in their determination to possess themselves
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150' name='page_150'></a>150</span>
of the paper. Finding it in her hand&ndash;&ndash;for she still
clutched it&ndash;&ndash;what then? Would they kill her?</p>
<p>The car was now completely at rest. The arm was
withdrawn from about her; hands gripped her hands and
forced them together; a handkerchief was tightly knotted
about her wrists. Afterwards her ankles were bound by
a strap. Then the blanket was lifted from her form
and head and she gasped in again pure night air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a gag,&rdquo; said the man at her side. &ldquo;Keep
quiet and I&rsquo;ll not use it; if you open your mouth to make
a sound, I shall. It&rsquo;s up to you.&rdquo; And with the hoarse
threat she caught the heavy sickening odor of whiskey
on the speaker&rsquo;s breath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You, Ed Sorenson! You&rsquo;ve dared to do this!&rdquo; she
exclaimed, fear vanishing in anger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sweetheart,&rdquo; came with a mocking accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Untie me this minute and let me out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. You&rsquo;ve got the wrong line on this little
game. We&rsquo;re going for a ride, just you and me, as
lovers should.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet began to think fast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did you know I was in Mr. Martinez&rsquo; office?&rdquo;
she demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because I saw you go in, little one. I was just pulling
up at your door to coax you out when I saw you and
the Mexican wench appear. So I followed along. Saved
me the bother of telling you your father had been hurt
in an accident. He&rsquo;s chasing off somewhere thirty miles
from town on a &lsquo;false alarm&rsquo; call to attend a dying man.
Sorry I had to use the blanket; sorry I have to keep
your naughty little hands and feet tied up. But it&rsquo;s
the only way. After we&rsquo;re married, you&rsquo;ll forget all
about it in loving me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So this was the face of the matter. Not the paper
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151' name='page_151'></a>151</span>
she gripped, but she herself was his object. His abduction
of her had nothing to do with Martinez&rsquo; affair; he
knew nothing of the larger plot; and for that reason
she experienced a degree of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never marry you, be certain of that,&rdquo; said she,
recurring to his statement. &ldquo;If anything had been
needed to settle that point, what you have done now
would be enough. You shall pay for this atrocious
treatment. Untie my hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. We&rsquo;re starting on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father as well as mine shall know of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think not, dearie. We&rsquo;re going up into the hills
where I&rsquo;ve a nice little cabin fixed up. And we&rsquo;ll stay
there awhile. And then when we come back, you&rsquo;ll not
do any talking. On the contrary, you&rsquo;ll be anxious to
marry me&ndash;&ndash;you&rsquo;ll be begging me to marry you. Of
course! People know we&rsquo;re engaged, and they&rsquo;ll know
you&rsquo;ve been away with me for two or three days. Do
you think they&rsquo;ll listen to any story about my carrying
you off against your will? They&rsquo;ll wink when they hear
it. Yes, you&rsquo;ll be ready to marry me all right, all right,
when we come back to San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s blood ran cold at this heartless, black plan
to ensnare her into marriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed, you would never do a thing like that,&rdquo; she
pleaded. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re just trying to scare me with a joke.
Be a good fellow and untie my hands and take me
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No joke about this; straight business. I told you
you should marry me&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re drunk or mad!&rdquo; she burst out, terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither; perfectly calm. But I&rsquo;m not the fellow
to be tossed over at a whim. I&rsquo;m holding you to your
word, that&rsquo;s all. You&rsquo;ll change your mind back as it
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152' name='page_152'></a>152</span>
was by to-morrow; you&rsquo;ll be crazy to have me as a
husband then. I won&rsquo;t have to tie your hands and feet
to keep you at my side when we come riding home to go
to the minister&rsquo;s. Now we&rsquo;ve had our little talk and
understand each other; and it&rsquo;s beginning to drizzle.
Time to start for our little cabin. The less fuss you
make, the pleasanter it will be for both of us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He set the gears and the car started forward once
more. A sensation of being under the paws of a beast,
odious and fetid, savage and pitiless, overwhelmed her.
That this was no trick of a moment but a calculated
scheme to abase and possess her she now realized with
a sort of dull horror. And on top of all he was, despite
his denial, partly drunk.</p>
<p>Through the terror of her situation two thoughts now
continued to course like fiery threads&ndash;&ndash;one a hope, one
a purpose. The former rested on Juanita, whom in
his inflamed ferocity of intention, the man seemed to
have forgotten&ndash;&ndash;on Juanita and Steele Weir, &ldquo;Cold
Steel&rdquo; Weir; and this failing, there remained the latter,
a set idea to kill herself before this brute at her
side worked his will. Somehow she could and would
kill herself. Somehow she would find the means to free
her hands and the instrument to pierce her heart.</p>
<p>Sorenson had switched on his lights. He drove the
car through the damp darkness at headlong speed along
the trail that leaped from the gloom to meet them and
vanished behind. At the end of a quarter of an hour he
swung into a canyon; and Janet perceived they were ascending
Terry Creek. He stopped the car anew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just take no chances with you,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;We have to pass your friends, the Johnsons, you know.
Had to take my stuff up here in the middle of the night&ndash;&ndash;up
one night and back the next&ndash;&ndash;and mighty still too,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153' name='page_153'></a>153</span>
so that they wouldn&rsquo;t suspicion I was fixing a little bower
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He bound a cloth over her mouth and again flung the
blanket over her head. Janet struggled fiercely for a
moment, but finally sank back choking and half in a
faint. She was barely conscious of the car&rsquo;s climbing
again. Though when passing the ranch house the man
drove with every care for silence, she was not aware
of the fact. Her breath, mind, soul, were stifled. She
seemed transfixed in a hideous nightmare.</p>
<p>At length her lips and head were released. But her
hands and feet were numb. Still feeling as if she were
in some dreadful dream she saw the beam of the headlights
picking out the winding trail, flashing on trees by
the wayside, shining on wet rocks, heard the chatter of
the creek over stones and the labor of the engine.</p>
<p>The road was less plain, a mere track now, and
steeper. They were climbing, climbing up the mountain
side, up into the heavier timber, up into one of the
&ldquo;parks&rdquo; among the peaks. Johnson&rsquo;s ranch was miles
behind and far below. Occasionally billows of fog
swathed them in wet folds that sent a chill to Janet&rsquo;s
bones.</p>
<p>Sorenson held his watch down to the driver&rsquo;s light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten o&rsquo;clock; we&rsquo;re making good time. Must give the
engine a drink&ndash;&ndash;and take one myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He descended to the creek with a bucket, bringing
back water to fill the steaming radiator. Afterwards,
standing in the light of the car&rsquo;s lamps, he tilted a flask
to his lips and drank deep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not far now; three or four miles. But it&rsquo;s slow
going. Have to make it on &lsquo;low&rsquo;,&rdquo; said he, swinging
himself up into his place.</p>
<p>Janet held her face turned away. She was thinking
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154' name='page_154'></a>154</span>
of Juanita and Steele Weir. Had the girl gone home
again? Or, terrified, had she run to her own home and
said nothing? Had the engineer come and waited and
learning nothing at last returned to the dam? Despair
filled her breast. Even should the Mexican girl have
apprised him of the kidnapping, how should he know
where to follow? And in the solitude of the wet dark
mountains all about her hope died.</p>
<p>She began desperately to tug against the handkerchief
binding her wrists.</p>
<p>Suddenly the going became easier and she felt rather
than saw that the trees had thinned. A flash of the car
lamps at a curve in the trail showed a great glistening
wall of rock towering overhead, then this was passed
and the way appeared to lead into a grassy open space.
A dark shape beside the road loomed into view&ndash;&ndash;a cabin
by a clump of pine trees. Sorenson brought the car to
a stop a few yards from the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here at last,&rdquo; he announced, springing down.</p>
<p>He unstrapped her feet, bade her get out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I make a last appeal to your decency and manhood&ndash;&ndash;if
you have either,&rdquo; she said, sitting motionless.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rot,&rdquo; he answered. Half dragging her, half lifting
her, he removed her from the machine. Slipping a hand
within her arm he led her inside the log house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit there,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>Janet dropped upon the seat, a rude plank bench
against the wall farthest from the door. Indeed, fatigue
and the numbness of her limbs rendered her incapable
of standing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I&rsquo;ve touched off this fire and set out some
grub, then I&rsquo;ll untie your hands,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;A
snug little cabin, eh? Just the place for us, what? See
all the stuff I&rsquo;ve brought up here to make you warm and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155' name='page_155'></a>155</span>
happy and comfortable. Regular nest. Lot of work on
my part, I want to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He touched a match to the wood already laid in the
fireplace, flung off his rain coat and stood to warm his
hands at the blaze. Lighting a cigarette, he began
placing from a box of supplies plates and food on the
table in the middle of the room, but paused to reproduce
his flask. With a sardonic grin he lifted the bottle,
bowed to Janet and drank the liquor neat. When he had
finished, he turned the bottle upside down to show it was
empty, then tossed it into a corner. Again he fixed his
drunken, mocking smile upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t preach to me about booze here, can you,
honey?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ought to take a swallow yourself;
warm you up. I have plenty. Guess I better untie your
hands now.&rdquo; He advanced towards her, swaying
slightly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to love me from this time on,
ain&rsquo;t you, girlie?&rdquo; He untied the handkerchief and
dropped it at his feet. &ldquo;No nonsense now about trying
to get away; I&rsquo;ll rope you for good if you try to start
anything. Hello, what&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; give it to me!&rdquo; she cried, in alarm as he pulled
the folded sheets of paper from her stiffened fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something I ought to see, maybe.&rdquo; Then he added
harshly, &ldquo;Sit down, if you don&rsquo;t care to have me teach
you a thing or two. I&rsquo;m master here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stepped to the table and drawing a box beside him
settled upon it, pulled the candle-stick nearer and began
to read the document. Janet glanced swiftly about the
room for a weapon. Escape past him she could not, for
by a single spring he could bar the way; but could she
lay hand on a stick of wood she might fight her way out.
None was nearer than the fire, and again he could interpose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156' name='page_156'></a>156</span></div>
<p>He read on and on, with a darkening brow and an
evil glint showing in his eyes. Page by page he perused
Saurez&rsquo; deposition until he reached the end. Then he
got to his feet, shaking the paper at her head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were in on this,&rdquo; he snarled. &ldquo;This is what you
were in Martinez&rsquo; office to get. You&rsquo;re wise to this
cursed scheme to help Weir make my father and Vorse
and Burkhardt and Judge Gordon out a gang of swindlers.
So they trimmed <i>his</i> father of something&ndash;&ndash;at least
I fancy they did, and I hope to God they did, the
coward! And you were in with them! You&rsquo;re not quite
the little white angel you&rsquo;d have people believe, are you?
Not quite so innocent and simple as you&rsquo;ve made me
think, anyway. Well, I&rsquo;ll square all that. That slippery
snake, Martinez, I&rsquo;ll twist his neck the minute I get back
to town. I&rsquo;ll bet a thousand it was framed up to use
this when Weir was arrested&ndash;&ndash;but he&rsquo;ll never use it
now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He glared at the girl with a face distorted by rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just burn it here and now,&rdquo; he continued.
&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll be sure it won&rsquo;t be used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet gripped her hands tightly, while her lips opened
to utter a wild protest at this desecration. What the
document contained she did not yet know, except that
it was evidence that fixed upon the men named guilt for
some past deed in which Weir had suffered and which
would bring them to account. But something more than
protest was needed, she saw in a flash, to deflect the man
from his purpose and save the sheets from the flame.</p>
<p>She shut her lips for an instant to choke the cry, then
said with an assumption of unconcern:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead. I didn&rsquo;t want your father to see it, in any
case.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The paper had almost reached the candle, but the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157' name='page_157'></a>157</span>
hand that held it paused. Sorenson stared at it, and
from it to her. At last a malignant curl of his lips
uncovered his teeth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you didn&rsquo;t want him to see it,&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;If
that&rsquo;s so, I&rsquo;ll just save it. He&rsquo;ll be interested in reading
what your friends have prepared to destroy his good
name and reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He folded the document and slipped it into his inner
coat pocket. Then he walked towards her. At the look
on his face Janet sprang to her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve changed my mind about the marriage matter,
just as you did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I agree with you now; there
won&rsquo;t be any marriage. But I&rsquo;ll have your arms about
my neck just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he seized her wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go, let&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The words ceased on her lips.</p>
<p>Her eyes were riveted on the cabin door; she scarcely
felt the man&rsquo;s loathsome touch on her arm. How had
the door come unlatched? And was it only the wind that
slowly moved it open?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h3>WEIR TAKES UP THE HUNT</h3>
</div>
<p>On leaving the construction camp Steele Weir had
whirled away down the river road for San Mateo with a
feeling both of satisfaction and of enmity&ndash;&ndash;satisfaction
at Martinez&rsquo; success in at last having secured the evidence
ardently desired, as betokened by his words;
enmity at whoever was laying violent hands on the
lawyer. Unfortunately when yet half a mile from town
his car suffered one of the common misadventures of
automobiles:&ndash;&ndash;ping-g-g! sang a tire in a shrill dying
whine.</p>
<p>Weir did not stop to change and inflate the tube, but
pushed ahead on his mission though at slackened speed.
He brought his car to rest before Doctor Hosmer&rsquo;s
house. The windows were lighted, yet at his knock there
was no response; so brushing conventionalities aside he
entered and called Janet&rsquo;s name. Only echoes and a
following silence greeted his call.</p>
<p>Doubtful whether to remain awaiting the girl&rsquo;s return
or go at once to Martinez&rsquo; office in the hope of still finding
her, he finally chose the latter course leaving his car
where it stood and proceeding on foot, as a result of
which he passed in the darkness Juanita hurrying home
in a fright. A bad choice and valuable time lost, he
afterwards discovered. At Martinez&rsquo; office he stepped
inside, called the lawyer by name, called Janet Hosmer,
stood for a little while in the black room harkening and
thinking, then went forth into the street.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159' name='page_159'></a>159</span></div>
<p>This time chance fell his way. He had but come out
when he heard footsteps and two men in low-toned talk
as they approached; and he withdrew further into the
concealing darkness of the street. The new visitors,
striking matches at the entrance, walked inside. The
men were Vorse and Burkhardt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you had been here, we could have nailed him at
once as soon as I had Saurez&rsquo; story,&rdquo; the former said.
&ldquo;Martinez had half an hour and more to get the thing
into somebody else&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I was looking after those men up in the hills,&rdquo;
was the growled answer. &ldquo;Had to feed &rsquo;em and have
&rsquo;em ready for to-morrow night. If we don&rsquo;t find the
document here, we&rsquo;ll screw its hiding-place out of that
dirty greaser if we have to use a cord on his head
Indian-fashion. Anyway it ought to be about this office.
Martinez didn&rsquo;t know you had learned about it from
Saurez. He&rsquo;d never let go a paper like that until he
had to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;re right there,&rdquo; Vorse said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;d want
to sell it for all it was worth. Better shut and lock the
door while we&rsquo;re searching. Don&rsquo;t care to have any of
his friends sticking in their heads while we&rsquo;re here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burkhardt, who had lighted the lamp, now closed the
door, cutting off so far as Steele Weir was concerned
both a view of the men and their conversation. However
he had learned if not enough, at least considerable.
They had not yet gained possession of the paper. They
knew nothing of Janet&rsquo;s part in the affair. They had
so far not succeeded in unlocking Martinez&rsquo; lips, but
undoubtedly they would be able to wring from the lawyer
when they went about it the real truth regarding the
document. Very likely Martinez had anticipated that,
had known his powers were such as not to be greatly able
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160' name='page_160'></a>160</span>
to resist physical torture and had planned to get the
evidence into the engineer&rsquo;s hands before he should be
subjected to pains of the flesh. That would be remembered
to his credit, along with all the rest. Where
Martinez was being held prisoner was the additional
information Weir should have liked to glean before the
door was shut.</p>
<p>Postponing for the time the hunt along this line, he
returned to the Hosmer dwelling. In answer to his
knock and call on this visit the trembling Juanita
appeared, immediately pouring forth a recital of the
happenings at the office as affecting her mistress.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve told no one else?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or. She said I was to say nothing of her
being there for the paper, and I was waiting for her
father to come. But she informed me Mr. Martinez and
you knew she was there, so I&rsquo;ve told you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you saw nothing of this man who cast the
blanket over her head and seized her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was dark; we had just come out of the office.
But&ndash;&ndash;but the car sounded like Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s. I&rsquo;ve
heard it start from here many times with the same loud
noise. They had quarreled, Se&ntilde;or Weir, and were no
longer engaged.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know. Which way did he drive off?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;East, down the lower end of the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bring a lamp out to my car, so I can fix my tire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the girl holding the light by his side the engineer
worked with concentrated energy in stripping the wheel,
in inserting a new tube, replacing the tire and pumping
it up. The thin drizzle glistened on his face, but for all
that it was none the less determined, stern.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You need not be afraid for yourself; no one but us
knows you were there,&rdquo; he said to her, climbing into his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161' name='page_161'></a>161</span>
machine. &ldquo;Nor for Miss Janet, either. I&rsquo;ll bring her
home safely. When Dr. Hosmer returns, tell him everything.
Also ask him to await our coming. Be sure and
say to him that I&rsquo;ll bring her home unharmed and that
I advise silence in regard to the matter until I have
talked with him. You will remain quiet, of course. This
isn&rsquo;t a thing to be gossiped about.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, se&ntilde;or.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away the automobile shot under the impulsion of the
gas. Minutes, golden minutes, had been wasted in
taking up the pursuit because of his going to Martinez&rsquo;
office and because of the flat tire. Sorenson now would
be miles away with his prisoner.</p>
<p>Sweeping out of town with the car&rsquo;s headlights illuminating
the road, Steele Weir blessed the drizzling mist
that dampened the dust so as to leave a tire&rsquo;s imprint.
Almost at once he picked up the track, for not more than
twenty or twenty-five minutes had elapsed since Sorenson&rsquo;s
flight and not even a horseman had since been
over the way.</p>
<p>Though he knew it not, the interval of time had been
reduced by the stop made by the first machine, a mile or
so out of town, when the abductor removed the blanket
from Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s head to announce his evil scheme.
From the main road leading to Bowenville Weir saw the
car&rsquo;s trail turn aside into a mesa track pointing obliquely
for Terry Creek canyon; and he suspected that Sorenson
was making a long drive northward, skirting the
mountain range and working away from the railroad-tapped
region.</p>
<p>Once he thought he caught a flash of light far ahead
of him, but knew this was an illusion. Through this
rainy darkness no car&rsquo;s beam, however powerful, would
show half a mile. The mist beat against his face in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162' name='page_162'></a>162</span>
steady stream as he rushed forward in the night, his
eyes immovable on the wet twin tire-marks stamped on
the road, his iron grip on the wheel, his ears filled with
the steady hum of the engine. If Sorenson had driven
fast, Steele Weir drove faster.</p>
<p>At Terry Creek he plunged down the bank, across the
water and up on the other side without a change of
gears, rocking and lurching. Once on the smooth trail
again the car seemed to stretch itself like a greyhound
for the race northward. But on a sudden he brought
the automobile to an abrupt halt. The surface of the
road was undisturbed; nothing had passed here.</p>
<p>Swinging back again on the way he had come, Weir
recrossed the creek and slowly retraced his course.
Then with an exclamation of satisfaction he picked up
the track where it turned up the canyon trail. But why
was the man going to the Johnson ranch? Mystified by
this baffling procedure on Sorenson&rsquo;s part, he nevertheless
headed up the stream with no lessening of his
purpose to overtake the other.</p>
<p>At the ranch house, whose kitchen window was lighted,
he stopped and leaped out. Johnson and Mary both
answered his thumping knock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Janet Hosmer here?&rdquo; he questioned, while his eyes
darted about the kitchen. Then he made his own reply,
&ldquo;I see she&rsquo;s not. Ed Sorenson kidnapped her to-night
and drove to this canyon. Did you hear a car?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary faced her father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remember I thought I heard one!&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;But the sound was so low I wasn&rsquo;t sure, and when I went
to the window I saw nothing. I didn&rsquo;t hear it again.
Father said it was just my imagination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does this road lead?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up into the timber and to a &lsquo;park.&rsquo; Used to be an
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163' name='page_163'></a>163</span>
old wood road. Sheepmen sometimes use it to take their
wagons up above; sometimes cattle outfits too while on
round-ups.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could an auto go ahead on it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess so. By hard driving.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s up there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir ran back to his car, jumped in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let me go with you,&rdquo; Johnson shouted after him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can handle the fellow,&rdquo; the engineer answered.
And again his machine started on. &ldquo;How long ago was
it that you heard him, Mary?&rdquo; was his parting question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Bout fifteen minutes ago,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes! But the girl&rsquo;s reckoning might be
vague, and &ldquo;fifteen&rdquo; minutes be half an hour. At any
rate, with the road ascending among the peaks
Sorenson&rsquo;s speed would be greatly diminished. The
incline would be against him, the uneven twisting rain-washed
trail would require careful driving, the rain
would hamper his sight. Yet the fellow he pursued
could not be more than three or four miles ahead at most.</p>
<p>On and on Weir pressed. The mist thickened; black
wet tree trunks loomed before him like ghosts and sank
out of view again; the road wound along the stream
among rocks and bushes and over hillocks with all the
difficult sinuosity of a serpent&rsquo;s track; in his ears
persisted the chuckling talk of the creek, flowing in
darkness except when lighted by his car&rsquo;s lamps as the
machine plunged through a ford, as became more and
more frequent with the ascent and the narrowing of the
canyon.</p>
<p>Five miles, ten miles, fifteen miles he must have come
since leaving the ranch house. His car now was high
in the mountain range, running on low gear, the engine
working hard in the thin air and against the steep grade.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164' name='page_164'></a>164</span>
He was not making more than five miles an hour, he
judged, at this moment. The radiator was boiling and
steaming like a cauldron. But he might be sure that if
his travel was slow, Sorenson&rsquo;s was no better; the road
was the same for the pursued as for the pursuer.</p>
<p>At the end of another half hour he came around a
ledge of rock, where the creek flowed some fifty feet below
and the granite wall allowed just room to pass in a
hair-pin turn. There a light gleamed before him like a
beacon, a dim gleam of a window. It was perhaps a
hundred yards distant. It marked the end of the trail,
the end of the search.</p>
<p>Here was Janet Hosmer!</p>
<p>And he had come in time. They could not have been
here long, for Sorenson&rsquo;s start had not been sufficient
for that; the scoundrel had not yet recovered his breath
from his hard drive, so to speak. He probably would
imagine himself safe and so be in no haste to consummate
his vile plan of enjoying his helpless victim.</p>
<p>Rage that until now had been lying cold and
implacable in Steele Weir&rsquo;s breast began to flame in his
veins and brain. He drove his car past the rock and off
the trail upon an open grassy space, very carefully,
very quietly. Next he stopped the engine and put out
the lights, then he got out, felt his gun in its holster and
gazed ahead for an instant.</p>
<p>A form had passed and repassed before the window&ndash;&ndash;Sorenson&rsquo;s
figure, of course. Brute, coward, degenerate
he was, and to be dealt with as such. Not only as such,
indeed, but as a wretch who had dared to touch Janet
Hosmer against her will, to drag her from her home to
this lonely spot by violence for his own bestial purposes.</p>
<p>The blood seemed like to burst Steele Weir&rsquo;s heart.
This sweet, honest, kind-souled, noble girl! Janet
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165' name='page_165'></a>165</span>
Hosmer, so bright-eyed and pure! She, who had suffered
this man&rsquo;s hate to save Martinez&rsquo; document, who had
dared peril to help him, Weir! All the hunger of heart
of years, and all the stifled affection, now went out to
her. He loved her; the veil was rent from his mind and
he realized the fact indisputably&ndash;&ndash;he loved Janet
Hosmer. And the great creature of an Ed Sorenson
had dared to seize her with brutal hands!</p>
<p>Weir broke into a run. By instinct he kept the trail,
though once or twice stumbling and once barely missing
a collision with a tree. When he reached the cabin, he
dropped to a walk and crept to the window, which was
without glass or frame, open to the night. Peering in
he perceived Sorenson at the table reading a document,
and as he watched he had no need to be told this was the
paper that so vitally concerned himself.</p>
<p>At last Sorenson got to his feet, shaking his hand at
Janet Hosmer who sat against the cabin wall and
beginning to speak. Weir listened for a little. Then
he stole along the log house to find the door.</p>
<p>At last his finger touched the latch. He lifted it
soundlessly, as silently pushed the door ajar until there
was space for him to slip in. This he did. His mouth
was shut hard, his eyes watchful, his right hand was
closed about the butt of his revolver still resting in the
holster.</p>
<p>Over Sorenson&rsquo;s shoulder he saw Janet Hosmer&rsquo;s face,
pale and drawn but with a sudden joy flaming there. If
ever gratitude were written on human countenance, it
was on hers. Gratitude&ndash;&ndash;and more! Something that
sent Steele Weir&rsquo;s blood rushing anew through his body,
with hope, with a song, with he knew not what.</p>
<p>Janet suddenly jerked herself free and stepped back,
her head held high and proud.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166' name='page_166'></a>166</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never touch me again, you coward. Look
behind you,&rdquo; she exclaimed.</p>
<p>Involuntarily Sorenson turned head on shoulder. The
frown still darkened his liquor-flushed face and the sneer
yet twisted his lips so that his mustache was drawn back
from his teeth. Thus he remained as if changed to stone.</p>
<p>What he saw was the man he most dreaded, with a
shadow of a smile on his lips, his figure motionless, his
hand ready, like an avenging Nemesis from out of the
night. A perceptible shudder shook the fellow. Weir it
was&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Cold Steel,&rdquo; whose counter-stroke against one
man already had been swift and deadly, whom nothing
checked or turned or terrified, who now for a second time
was plucking away the fruit of Sorenson&rsquo;s efforts, who
probably on this occasion would shoot him outright.</p>
<p>For a moment Steele Weir regarded him in silence.
But at last he spoke:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand away from that lady, you skunk!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson moved hastily aside.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII</h2>
<h3>EARTH&rsquo;S RETRIBUTION</h3>
</div>
<p>Steele Weir crossed the cabin to Janet&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are unhurt?&rdquo; he asked, his eyes scanning her
face anxiously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And, oh, how glad I am you came!&rdquo; she cried,
low. &ldquo;I knew you would not fail me if you but learned
of my plight; but it&rsquo;s wonderful you should be here so
soon. I prayed every minute of my ride that Juanita
would find and tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come half as fast as I wished.&rdquo; His smile
assured and cheered her. Then as his glance fell on her
wrists, still red and creased from being bound, he
exclaimed, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this? Let me see.&rdquo; And he caught
and lifted her hands to look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had you tied?&rdquo; Weir&rsquo;s gaze moved away to
Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Hands and feet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All the way? All the long ride?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes&ndash;&ndash;look out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s words, half a gasp, half a shriek, gave
warning of Sorenson&rsquo;s movement, though none was
needed. While apparently neglecting to watch the other,
Weir had kept the man sharp in the corner of his eye.
The motion with which his hand darted to his hip and
up again was a single lightning-like sweep; and his
weapon covered his enemy before the latter&rsquo;s hand so
much as got his revolver in grasp.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168' name='page_168'></a>168</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Drop it; drop it on the floor!&rdquo; the engineer ordered.
The gun clattered on the rough-hewn logs. &ldquo;Now put
your hands up and turn your back this way.&rdquo; Sorenson
obeyed, not without his eyes speaking the disappointed
wrath and hatred his tongue dared not utter. &ldquo;I should
have allowed you to make a full draw and then killed
you,&rdquo; Steele Weir went on. &ldquo;That would have been the
simplest way to settle your case. Only I don&rsquo;t like to
kill bunglers, even when they deserve it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He re-sheathed his own gun and strode forward,
picking up the one on the floor&ndash;&ndash;a black, ugly-looking
automatic. This he dropped into a coat pocket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now face about, you cur,&rdquo; he commanded. &ldquo;I want
a good look at a man&ndash;&ndash;no, I&rsquo;ll not call you a man&ndash;&ndash;at a
low-lived imitation of a man who is such a sneaking, dirty
beast that all he can do is to trap and tie up a helpless
girl. I don&rsquo;t know yet just what I shall do with you,
but I know what I ought to do&ndash;&ndash;I ought to choke the
miserable life out of you! You&rsquo;re not fit to live. You
soil the earth and pollute the air. But you&rsquo;re of the
same treacherous, underhanded, scoundrelly breed as
your father, same yellow flesh and blood, same crooked
mind and heart, same sort of poisonous snake, and since
you get it all from him I suppose it can&rsquo;t be helped. Nor
changed, except by killing and burying you. One thing
is sure, when I&rsquo;m done you won&rsquo;t be trying any more
deals like this. Bah, you slimy reptile, you belong in a
cess-pool!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Under Steele Weir&rsquo;s biting speech Sorenson&rsquo;s face
went red and pale by turns. His lips twitched and
worked, moving his mustache in little angry lifts, while
he breathed with short spasmodic intakes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;First, you&rsquo;re after Mexican girls,&rdquo; Weir went on
mercilessly. &ldquo;Then Mary Johnson, whom I pulled out
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169' name='page_169'></a>169</span>
of your vile fingers. And now it&rsquo;s&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; The engineer&rsquo;s
fist arose suddenly above the other&rsquo;s head. &ldquo;Why, I
ought to drop you dead in your tracks for so much as
looking at Janet Hosmer! Why don&rsquo;t you fight? Why
don&rsquo;t you give me a chance, you cowardly girl-robber?
Haven&rsquo;t you a spark of&ndash;&ndash;well, you haven&rsquo;t, I see. I&rsquo;ll
just tie you up and later figure out some way to make
you suffer for this night&rsquo;s work.&rdquo; And with a gesture
of disgust Weir turned away.</p>
<p>It was the moment Sorenson had been waiting for.
As the engineer&rsquo;s back came about, exposed in one
instant of carelessness, the man struck Weir full force on
the neck, sending him staggering. Then Sorenson leaped
for the doorway.</p>
<p>Janet screamed. Weir recovered himself and whirled
around, whipping forth his revolver and firing two shots.
But the bullets only buried themselves in the door
slammed shut after the escaping prisoner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I myself ought to be shot for this,&rdquo; Steele snapped
out.</p>
<p>He ran across the cabin, flung the door open, sprang
out. The uselessness of seeking his enemy in the black
wet gloom was only too evident, but he would not give up.
Gun in hand, he stood listening for sound of fleeing
footsteps.</p>
<p>A light hand gripped his arm. Janet had followed
him out, was at his side. Barely audible he heard her
quick, excited breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Must you shoot him?&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why spare him for more deviltry? But I&rsquo;ll not have
the chance now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t bear to think of even his blood being on our
hands. Let him go,&rdquo; Janet said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gone without our permission, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170' name='page_170'></a>170</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it just as well? I&rsquo;m not harmed, and he&rsquo;ll never
dare show his face in San Mateo again,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have to stay away; he&rsquo;ll leave for good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until I see him first. I want that paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the paper, I forgot it! And it&rsquo;s in his pocket,&rdquo;
she cried, in despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like the fool I was, I forgot it for the moment too,&rdquo;
Steele said bitterly. &ldquo;When I could have had it at once
I must go off ranting about his meanness. It was
thought of what he had done to you that made me overlook
the paper; that set me boiling. Lost my head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s answer was almost sufficient recompense
for even such a serious deprivation as that of the document.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget that you were angry in my behalf,&rdquo;
she said, softly. &ldquo;But perhaps you can gain possession
of the paper yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before he could make a reply the sound of a motor
engine startled them. Sorenson was in his car, not far
off. Weir immediately plunged forward through the
darkness in the direction of the noise, uttering a shout
for the man to stop or be shot. But after the taste of
liberty that he already had had Sorenson was prepared
to take further chances; the engine&rsquo;s roar burst into
full volume and the car leaped ahead, while its driver
sent back a derisive curse to the cabin.</p>
<p>Weir fired again, fired two or three times at the sound.
Perhaps Sorenson was crouching safely out of range; at
any rate, the bullets did not reach him, for the automobile
plunged away. Steele slowly went back to the
girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can he see without lights?&rdquo; she questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t see, but he&rsquo;d rather risk not seeing the road
than drawing my fire. There&rsquo;s a bad place there at the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171' name='page_171'></a>171</span>
rock; he&rsquo;d better turn on his lamps if he wants to round
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensing the danger that threatened Sorenson, both
remained unmoving, trying to penetrate the darkness,
harkening to the automobile&rsquo;s retreating murmur. A
curiosity, a sort of detached suspense, rooted them to
the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, he&rsquo;s snapped them on!&rdquo; Janet said, almost with
relief.</p>
<p>The powerful beam of the headlights had suddenly
blazed forth. Either feeling that he was safe from
Weir&rsquo;s gun or realizing that he was on the verge of a
graver danger, Sorenson had chosen to make the light.
He was going at headlong speed; even where they
watched, Steele and Janet perceived that,&ndash;&ndash;and only his
fear of the peril behind which made him heedless of the
difficulties in front could account for that reckless pace.</p>
<p>The light leaped out into the night. Something else
too seemed to spring forth within the circle of the glow,
dark, sudden, imminent, rushing at the machine. A
frantic jerk this way and that of the beam showed the
driver&rsquo;s mad effort to avoid the towering wall of granite.
Then a scream rang back to the man and girl before
the cabin. Followed instantly a crash, an extinguishment
of the light, darkness, silence, and finally a thin
quivering flame at the base of the ledge, delicate and
blue, like a dancing chimera.</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s hand reached out and closed in Steele Weir&rsquo;s,
and he covered it with his other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, how terrible!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Did you see? The
rock seemed to smite him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must be dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remain here and I&rsquo;ll go find out.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172' name='page_172'></a>172</span></div>
<p>He led her into the cabin and to a stool by the table,
where resting her elbows on the board she pressed her
hands over her eyes as if to blot out the sight she had
just witnessed. After all she had suffered, the climax
of this dreadful spectacle left her unnerved, weak,
shuddering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stay long,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Come back as
quick as you can. This cabin, this whole spot in the
mountains, is awful. I can almost feel him hovering
over me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t permit such thoughts.&rdquo; He gave her
shoulder an encouraging pat. &ldquo;It will take but a few
minutes to see if he&rsquo;s still alive and then we&rsquo;ll start home.
You&rsquo;ve been the bravest girl going and will continue to
be, I know. Everything is over; nothing can happen
to you now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir went out. He perceived that the wrecked car
was fully afire by this time, its flames illuminating the
granite ledge and the ground about. Evidently the
machine&rsquo;s fuel tank had been smashed under the impact
and the gasoline had escaped, preventing an explosion
but fiercely feeding the blaze. He ran towards the place.</p>
<p>At first he did not find Sorenson, so that he supposed
him buried beneath the wreckage, but presently he
discovered his crumpled form lying jammed between the
base of the ledge and a boulder. Weir lifted the limp
figure from its resting place and bore it to open ground,
where he made an examination of the still form. Clearly
Sorenson had been pitched free of the car and crushed
against the rock wall. His cap was missing; his coat
was ripped up the back and a part of it gone as if caught
and held by some obstruction in the car when he had
been shot forth; blood and a great bruise marked one
cheek; and the way his legs dragged when he was lifted
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173' name='page_173'></a>173</span>
up indicated some serious injury to those members. But
the man still breathed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miracles haven&rsquo;t ceased,&rdquo; Weir muttered, when he
had made sure of the fact. &ldquo;But his chance is slim at
best.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be false to say that the engineer felt
compassion at the other&rsquo;s sudden catastrophe; he
experienced none. On the contrary he had a sense of
justice fittingly executed, as if, escaping bullets and
man&rsquo;s blows, Sorenson had been felled by a more certain
power, by the inevitable consequences of his own deeds
and sins, by a wall of evil he himself had raised as much
as by a wall of stone.</p>
<p>He searched the man&rsquo;s breast pocket, then hunted for
the missing document among the stones and bushes. At
last he gave up for the time further seeking, with a
conviction that the vital paper was gone for good,
destroyed in the fire of the burning car. But for his
own over-confidence, his belief he had Sorenson a safe
prisoner back there in the cabin, the sheets might be
secure in his pocket. Well, it was too late now.</p>
<p>He again lifted the unconscious man in his arms and
returned to the log house. Inside he laid him on the
rude bed which Sorenson himself had spread with sheets
and blankets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive?&rdquo; Janet asked, awed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alive, but badly hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll leave him here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, while I take you away. We could do nothing
for him in any case; his injuries are grave and need a
doctor&rsquo;s help. The best service we can perform in his
behalf is to start your father or some other physician
here as quickly as possible. He may live or he may die;
that isn&rsquo;t in our hands. He&rsquo;s unconscious and not
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174' name='page_174'></a>174</span>
suffering, and probably will not feel pain for some hours
if he does live, so we can go without feeling that we&rsquo;re
robbing him of any of his chances of recovery. Your
conscience may rest quite easy on that point. Come,
we&rsquo;ll start at once. The quicker we reach your father,
the quicker he will arrive here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When they were in his car he wrapped a robe about
her against the sharp chill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am cold; my teeth are chattering,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been under a great strain. Just lie back and
rest and think of something else than what has happened,
if you can,&rdquo; he urged.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lamps blazed out at his touch of the switch and
the car began to move. She closed her eyes. She did
not wish to see the scene of the smash, with the leaping
fire and the horrible pile of crushed metal. Indeed, she
drew the robe before her face, where she kept it for some
time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we past the place?&rdquo; she asked, finally.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A long way past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank heaven! Nothing shall ever drag me up this
road again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will not take us long to reach Johnson&rsquo;s and be off
this trail altogether, for it&rsquo;s down-hill going all the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You said nothing about the paper? Did you get it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; it wasn&rsquo;t on him. I&rsquo;ll return for another look,
but it fell in the fire, I think, and burned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know what was in it, Mr. Weir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But I can guess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know a little of its contents, from what he said
before you entered. It was a statement, something
about his father and others doing dishonest acts, I think.
He didn&rsquo;t seem to be quite clear what it was about
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175' name='page_175'></a>175</span>
either, but he spoke of your father and declared he hoped
the others had swindled him, which he inferred had
happened. I didn&rsquo;t know your father ever had been in
this country. That&rsquo;s the reason you hate those men,
Mr. Sorenson and Mr. Vorse and Mr. Burkhardt;
because of some injury they worked your father.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the reason. And that too is why they&rsquo;re
trying to get rid of me one way or another. But they
didn&rsquo;t hire the Mexican to attempt to shoot me;
Ed Sorenson employed him. Martinez, when you told
me the man&rsquo;s name, telegraphed around the country
from Bowenville till he got track of the fellow. He also
secured evidence that a white man resembling Ed
Sorenson had been seen talking with him at the place he
came from. So we can draw our conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then he hired the man to assassinate you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like it. Because I took Mary Johnson away
from him, and from fear. He was afraid you might
learn of the matter, I suppose, and decided to get rid of
me. He&rsquo;s a coward at heart, but none the less a criminal
by instinct, so he hired another to do what he dared not
attempt himself. A crook like his father, but with less
nerve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet was silent while the car wound its way down
the creek road, through the misty darkness and among
the invisible peaks. The full danger that she had
escaped was but now making itself clear to her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he would go so far as to try to murder you,&rdquo; she
faltered, &ldquo;I surely could have expected no pity from
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now listen to me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to give you
a little scolding: you must forget all this business; it
just makes you fearful and unhappy. The past is over,
and he&rsquo;s out of your life for good. Look at it that way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176' name='page_176'></a>176</span>
Consider the thing as a bad dream, done with and no
more important. That&rsquo;s &lsquo;the right view to take&rsquo;&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he
paused, then added softly&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How strong-souled you are!&rdquo; she whispered.</p>
<p>Strong, in truth, he seemed. Ignoring danger he had
come swift on Sorenson&rsquo;s track and rescued her, saved
her, kept her clean from her assailant&rsquo;s infamous
brutishness. The one was a knave and a beast; but he,
Steele Weir, was a man, clear to see, quick to act, hard
towards enemies, gentle to friends. Every particle a
man&ndash;&ndash;sure of himself, and fearless, and true-hearted, and
firm of soul.</p>
<p>She pressed her hands tight against her breast. He
was a man one could love and honor. &ldquo;Cold Steel&rdquo; Weir
they called him&ndash;&ndash;and, she divined, his love if ever given
would be as lasting as hoops of steel.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h3>IN THE NIGHT WATCHES</h3>
</div>
<p>A light still burned in the Johnson ranch house, late
as was the hour, when the car swung round a copse of
aspens and brought it in view. Johnson himself came
forth at sound of the automobile, with a sleepy Mary
following.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t go to bed, of course, knowing you were
to come back,&rdquo; said he. But his true reason appeared in
his added words, &ldquo;I was just about ready to saddle a
horse and head up there myself. Mighty glad to see you
safe back, Miss Hosmer. Mary has had some coffee on
the fire ever since Weir went along, knowing you&rsquo;d be
cold and worn out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just the thing!&rdquo; Steele exclaimed. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re both
chilled. Come, Janet.&rdquo; And he stepped from the
machine.</p>
<p>Without demur the girl placed her hand in the one he
offered and descended stiffly. Mary ran back into the
house to attend to the coffee-pot and the visitors presently
were seated at the kitchen table at places already
laid, with cups of steaming strong coffee and plates of
food before them.</p>
<p>Janet contented herself with the hot, reviving drink,
but Weir ate heartily as well. Coming and going, forty
miles of driving a rough mountain road had given him a
laborer&rsquo;s appetite.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s late, one o&rsquo;clock,&rdquo; Mary said to Janet. &ldquo;Why
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178' name='page_178'></a>178</span>
don&rsquo;t you stay with us the rest of the night? I wish
you would.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet put up an arm and drew down the face of the
girl at her side and kissed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a good friend, Mary, to be so thoughtful,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;But father will be terribly anxious
every minute I&rsquo;m away. I must reach home as quickly
as possible to ease his mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of Sorenson nothing had been spoken, though a
repressed curiosity on the part of the ranchman and his
daughter had been evident from the instant of Weir&rsquo;s
and Janet&rsquo;s return.</p>
<p>At this point Johnson jerked his head in the direction
of the creek.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What did you do to him, Weir?&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not as much as I intended at first. But he made up
for it himself. Ran his car against that granite ledge
before the cabin while trying to get away, and smashed
himself up badly. I carried him into the hut and left
him there; he was alive when we drove off, but he may
be dead by now. Bad eggs like him are hard to kill,
however. I&rsquo;ll start a doctor up there when I arrive in
San Mateo; probably one from Bowenville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father won&rsquo;t attend him now, so long as there&rsquo;s
another physician who can, I know,&rdquo; Janet stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should say not!&rdquo; Johnson asseverated. &ldquo;If that
young hound Sorenson had his deserts, we&rsquo;d just leave
him there and forget all about him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where our civilized notions handicap us,&rdquo;
Steele Weir said, with a slight smile. &ldquo;But at that, if he
were the only person concerned, I&rsquo;d do no more than inform
a doctor where he was and what had happened to
him, and wash my hands of the affair. There are other
things, though, to consider. Janet&rsquo;s position, primarily.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179' name='page_179'></a>179</span>
Her case is similar to that of Mary&rsquo;s awhile ago, and we
must prevent talk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The worst of the doings of a scoundrel like him that
involve innocent people is the talk. There are always
some people low enough to ascribe evil to the girl as well
as the man in such a circumstance as this. I propose to
see that Janet doesn&rsquo;t suffer that. We avoided it in
Mary&rsquo;s case and we&rsquo;ll do so in this, though the situation
is more difficult. I&rsquo;ve been thinking the matter over on
the way down and have a plan that will work out, I
believe, but it requires your help, Johnson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon you know you&rsquo;ll not have to ask me twice for
anything,&rdquo; the rancher remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we may have to shuffle the facts a bit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll do all the lying necessary and never
bat an eye.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It won&rsquo;t require much decorating, the story. But
you will have to go up and get him, starting at once.&rdquo;
Then he concluded, &ldquo;I hate to have to ask you to make
that drive late at night and in the darkness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never mind that. Glad to do it, if that&rsquo;s what you
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take your wagon and fill the box with hay and bring
him down. By coming back slowly he won&rsquo;t be jarred,
and he has to be brought out anyway. If he&rsquo;s dead,
well, bring his body just the same. A doctor should be
easily at your house by the time you arrive; and your
story is that a sheepherder found him lying by his
wrecked car, carried him into the cabin and then came
down and told you of the accident, on which you went
and brought him in, not knowing, of course, in the dark
who he was or what he was doing up there or how the
smash-up had occurred. You might suggest that he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180' name='page_180'></a>180</span>
was camping there by himself to fish, and stop at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll say just enough and no more,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you start at once, you&rsquo;ll be there by daylight if
not before. That will get you back here by nine or ten
o&rsquo;clock. I don&rsquo;t want him taken to San Mateo; that
would stir up a swarm of inquiries and might even send
some of the curious up to the spot. Let the trail get
cold, so to speak. People aren&rsquo;t half as curious about a
thing three or four days after it happens as at the
moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve noticed that myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And another thing, I don&rsquo;t wish his father to learn of
the matter just yet. Under other circumstances he
should be the first to know, but I want the news kept
from him for a special reason. Besides, it would be
better if he found out about it from others and through
roundabout channels. His son up there I don&rsquo;t see
doing any talking himself for some time if he does
live. When he is able to talk, I believe he&rsquo;ll decide to
keep his mouth shut or just accept the explanation given
that he was fishing or something of that kind. When
the doctor has looked him over, either he or you will
carry him to Bowenville. If we could ship him at once
to Gaston, where there&rsquo;s some sort of a hospital, I
suppose, or even to Santa F&eacute;, that would be the thing.
He&rsquo;d be out of the way; there&rsquo;d be no talk; there would
be no explanations to make except to the doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every doctor round these parts probably knows
him,&rdquo; Johnson said, &ldquo;and so would insist on taking him
home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a new one at Bowenville, father says,&rdquo; Janet
put in. &ldquo;A young man, just starting practice. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181' name='page_181'></a>181</span>
hasn&rsquo;t been there but a few weeks and may not know Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the man for us!&rdquo; Weir declared. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll send
for him. Now we must be going.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele arose from the table and stretched his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll hitch up my team immediately,&rdquo; the rancher
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go with you,&rdquo; Mary exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut, tut, girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can help you, and I want to do something to help
Mr. Weir and Janet Hosmer, even if it&rsquo;s only a little bit.
I&rsquo;m strong, I don&rsquo;t care if it is late&ndash;&ndash;anyway, I&rsquo;d just
have nightmares if I stayed here alone,&ndash;&ndash;and I can help
you with him. I&rsquo;m going,&rdquo; she ended, obstinately.</p>
<p>Johnson eyed her for a moment, then yielded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing to be afraid of now,&rdquo; he rejoined, &ldquo;but
if you would rather go along with your dad, all
right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later Steele and Janet were emerging
from the canyon upon the mesa. The drizzling rain still
continued and the unseen mist beat cool upon their
cheeks as the car swung away from Terry Creek for
town. Except for the stream of light projected before
them, they were engulfed in Stygian darkness; and save
for the slithering sound of the tires on the wet road,
they moved in profound night silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That business is arranged,&rdquo; Steele said, after a time.
&ldquo;But we still have the results of the attack on Martinez
to deal with. I don&rsquo;t know how long he&rsquo;ll hold out
against the men who dragged him off, probably not long.
I suppose Burkhardt and perhaps Vorse took him, and
they&rsquo;ll stop at nothing to get the paper they&rsquo;re after.
How they learned of it, I don&rsquo;t know, but find out about
it they did; and they&rsquo;ll force the information they want
from Martinez if they have to resort to hot irons.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182' name='page_182'></a>182</span>
That&rsquo;s the kind of men they are. The lawyer will stick
up to a certain point&ndash;&ndash;then he&rsquo;ll tell. That brings you
into their way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You also,&rdquo; Janet answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been there for some time,&rdquo; was his grim
response. &ldquo;But in your case it&rsquo;s different. I&rsquo;m worried,
I tell you frankly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think they would dare try to intimidate me
in my own home and with father to protect me?&rdquo; she
cried, incredulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not there, perhaps. But if they could inveigle you
away, yes. They wouldn&rsquo;t use hot irons in your case, of
course, and I can&rsquo;t guess just what they would do, but
they would do&ndash;&ndash;something. Those men think I have the
&lsquo;goods&rsquo; on them; I repeat, they would stop at nothing to
save themselves if worst came to worst; their fear will
make them fiends. One couldn&rsquo;t suppose they would
dare seize Martinez in all defiance of law&ndash;&ndash;but they did.
One can&rsquo;t believe they would dream of torturing him for
information&ndash;&ndash;but I haven&rsquo;t a doubt that&rsquo;s what they&rsquo;ve
done. So you see why I&rsquo;m worried about you. If
anything happened, if any harm came to you now,
Janet&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>His voice was unsteady as he spoke her name and
ceased abruptly. She thrilled to this betrayal of his
feeling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish I could just stick at your side, then I know I
should be safe,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>And for answer she felt his hand grope and press her
own for an instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can count on me being somewhere around.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; she said, confidently.</p>
<p>San Mateo was asleep, buried in gloom when they
entered it, and quiet except for the barking of a dog
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183' name='page_183'></a>183</span>
or two that their passage stirred to activity. But in
Dr. Hosmer&rsquo;s cottage a light was burning and as the
car came to a stop at its gate the door was flung open
and the doctor himself appeared framed in the doorway.
He ran hastily down the walk to meet them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Janet!&rdquo; he cried. And the girl flung her arms about
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Juanita told you? Oh, it was dreadful! But Mr.
Weir has brought me home safe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hosmer too agitated to speak reached out and
grasped the engineer&rsquo;s hand, pressing it fervently.</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At about that moment three men sat in the rear of
Vorse&rsquo;s saloon. The shades were drawn and the front
part of the long room was dark. Only a dull light
burned where they sat. They were talking in low tones,
with long pauses, with worried but determined, savage
faces&ndash;&ndash;Vorse, Burkhardt, Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where the devil is she, that&rsquo;s what I want to know!&rdquo;
Burkhardt growled. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been over twice and looked
through a window. Doc was there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s in bed and asleep, probably,&rdquo; Sorenson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it. The old man would be in the sheets
himself if that were the case. Didn&rsquo;t I call up twice by
&rsquo;phone too? She was out, they said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t do much with her father there, anyway.
We&rsquo;ve got to get the paper by soft talk,&rdquo; Vorse
commented. &ldquo;I still half believe Martinez was lying
when he said it had been in that old chair. She couldn&rsquo;t
have got to the office and away in the hour or two before
he told without some one seeing her, and no one did so far
as we can learn. We locked the door too the second
time we went back and it hasn&rsquo;t been opened since; and
we were there ten minutes after our first visit when we
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184' name='page_184'></a>184</span>
learned the papers weren&rsquo;t among those in his pocket. I
think he&rsquo;s got it cached away somewhere still.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll give him another dose of our medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I know anything about men, he told the truth,&rdquo;
Sorenson said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, if the girl has it, we&rsquo;ve got to get it from her if
I have to wring her neck to do it.&rdquo; It was Burkhardt&rsquo;s
inflamed utterance.</p>
<p>A pause followed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorenson, your boy is engaged to her,&rdquo; Vorse stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then it&rsquo;s up to him to get it first thing in the
morning. Maybe it goes against the grain to let him
know about this business of the past, but it ain&rsquo;t going to
knock him over; he&rsquo;s no fool, he&rsquo;s a wise bird, he understands
that a good many things are done in business that
aren&rsquo;t advertised. He knows we weren&rsquo;t missionaries in
the old days. And she&rsquo;ll hand it over for him when she
might not for any one else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, Sorenson,&rdquo; Burkhardt affirmed, his
scowling face visibly clearing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ed went away somewhere this evening, that&rsquo;s the only
drawback to your scheme. Said something about
Bowenville and catching the night train to Santa F&eacute;, and
that he might be gone maybe a couple of days and maybe
a week.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hell!&rdquo; Burkhardt exploded, in consternation.</p>
<p>Vorse however remained cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you must start telegrams to head him off, start
them the instant you get home. Telephone to Bowenville
the message you want sent and have the operator
dispatch it to all trains going both ways since early
evening, in order to make sure. If you can reach him
within two or three hours, wherever he is, he can hop off,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185' name='page_185'></a>185</span>
catch a train back and be here by to-morrow evening.
Make your message urgent. And meanwhile we&rsquo;ll do
what we can to get hold of that paper. At any rate we
can keep her from seeing Weir. If we have to watch her
we&rsquo;ll do it; and if we have to stop her from going to the
dam we&rsquo;ll do that someway too. You might invite her
over to-morrow to spend the day at your house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;ll be likely to come if she reads that
document?&rdquo; the banker inquired coldly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not? Tell her right off the bat that the thing
is a lie and a forgery and that you want to explain about
how it was made. She might fall for that and carry the
document to you. She&rsquo;s always had a good opinion of
you, hasn&rsquo;t she?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why should she change at a mere story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; Sorenson exclaimed with sudden
energy. &ldquo;The matter described happened so long ago
that she won&rsquo;t probably attach as much importance to it
as we&rsquo;ve imagined she would. I&rsquo;ll ask her to bring it to
me to see&ndash;&ndash;and that will be all that&rsquo;s necessary, once it&rsquo;s
in my fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about him?&rdquo; Burkhardt asked, striking the
floor with his heel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just leave him there for the present. To-morrow
we&rsquo;ll have another talk with him,&rdquo; the cattleman stated.
&ldquo;Better offer him a couple of thousand to go to another
state; he&rsquo;ll grab at the chance, I fancy. Money heals
most wounds. But, Vorse, keep your cellar locked and
the bartender away from it. We can start Martinez
away sometime to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know about that. To-morrow night will be
our busy night,&rdquo; the ex-sheriff said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We might let Gordon handle him,&rdquo; Vorse suggested.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186' name='page_186'></a>186</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I thought perhaps you intended to keep the Judge in
ignorance of this Martinez matter. He seems to be
getting sort of feeble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s not too feeble to take his share of the unpleasant
jobs along with the rest of us,&rdquo; Vorse answered, unfeelingly.
&ldquo;I shall have him in here first thing in the morning
and tell him what&rsquo;s happened and what we&rsquo;ve done
and what he has to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Burkhardt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s agreeable to me,&rdquo; Sorenson stated,
looking at his watch and rising: &ldquo;Time we were turning
in, if there&rsquo;s nothing more.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>At the dam camp Meyers, the assistant chief engineer,
and Atkinson, the superintendent, were still awake,
smoking and talking in the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I smelt enough booze on those fellows who came
stringing in here to fill the reservoir,&rdquo; the latter was
saying. &ldquo;Some one&rsquo;s feeding it to them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobody drunk, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. But who&rsquo;s giving it to them and why? I asked
one fellow and he said he&rsquo;d been to a birthday party, and
wouldn&rsquo;t tell where. They were all feeling pretty lush,
even if they weren&rsquo;t soused. And to-morrow&rsquo;s Sunday!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll all be idle, you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sure. If there&rsquo;s more liquor, they&rsquo;ll be after it. All
day to drink in means a big celebration. The whiskey is
sent up from town, of course, and I reckon sent just at
this time to get us all in bad while Mr. Pollock&rsquo;s here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll look up the bootlegging nest to-morrow,&rdquo;
Meyers said, with finality.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What can we do if we do locate it? They&rsquo;re not
selling the stuff, I judge, but giving it away. That
clears their skirts and forces us to deal with the men
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187' name='page_187'></a>187</span>
themselves if there&rsquo;s any dealing done. Probably they
hope to start a big row among us that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll await Weir&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve waited all I&rsquo;m going to to-night. Seems
to me for a steady, quiet, self-respecting, dignified,
unhooked, unmarried, unmortgaged, unromantic man he&rsquo;s
skylarking and gallivanting around pretty late.&rdquo;</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>On the rocky creek road the ranchman and his
daughter Mary were driving up among the trees on their
way to the cabin, a lantern swinging from the end of the
wagon tongue, the horses straining against the grade.
On Johnson&rsquo;s beard the moisture formed beads which
from time to time he brushed away. From the trees
collected drops of water fell on their hands and knees.
All about as they proceeded the bushes and rocks
appeared in shadowy outline, to disappear in the night
once more, yielding to others.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this cabin where we&rsquo;re going the one we drove
to three years ago when you were hunting some cattle?&rdquo;
Mary asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never thought then that Ed Sorenson would be
lying up there all mashed to pieces,&rdquo; she said, with awed
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess he didn&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; was the dry response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be ready to stop chasing girls after
this,&rdquo; she declared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t if he can walk; his kind never does quit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then his kind ought to be locked up somewhere like
mad dogs. In a &rsquo;sylum, maybe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right on that, Mary. They&rsquo;re
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny we didn&rsquo;t know he&rsquo;d been up there, going past
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188' name='page_188'></a>188</span>
our house. He must have been there first before taking
Janet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sneaked up in the night, probably. He&rsquo;d have to
have grub and so on if he expected to stay even a day or
two. Crooks always look after their bellies, be sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon Janet Hosmer will like Mr. Weir a whole lot
now, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She ought to, if she doesn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A long silence followed while Mary apparently pursued
the line of thought opened up by this speculation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If she has the good sense I think she has,&rdquo; the rancher
stated at length, for his mind at least had been following
out the subject, &ldquo;she&rsquo;ll not only like him a whole
lot, but she&rsquo;ll lead him to the altar and put her brand on
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke to unhearing ears. For just then Mary
sagged against him, her head sank on his shoulder. He
put an arm around her form and let her sleep, thus
roughly expressing his tenderness and love. Weir had
not only rescued Janet Hosmer from the clutches of the
man now lying injured; he also had once saved Johnson&rsquo;s
own child Mary from the scoundrel&rsquo;s grasp.</p>
<p>Weir might ask anything of him, even to the laying
down of his life in his defense.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h3>A QUEER PAPER</h3>
</div>
<p>When Mary Johnson next opened her eyes it was at
a little shake by her father. She had slept heavily despite
the jolting of the wagon; and now looked about
drowsy-eyed and at a loss to know where she was. Her
clothes and face were damp, her hands cold. She wasn&rsquo;t
sure yet but this was still a dream&ndash;&ndash;the team and wagon,
the cabin before which they stood, the trees and rocks
scattered about the grassy park-like basin, and the
soaring mountain peaks on every hand that were just
touched by the first early sun-rays.</p>
<p>The rain and mists were gone, leaving the dawn clear,
gray, sharp, scented with the pungent odor of balsam
and pine. From a distance came the subdued murmur of
Terry Creek, which here high in the mountain range had
its source in springs and brooks flowing from pools. All
was peaceful.</p>
<p>Mary&rsquo;s look came to rest on the cabin. Over it reared
the great pines that grew in a clump behind. Its door
was ajar, but the log house for any sign of occupancy
might have been untenanted. Immediately the girl
glanced back along the road they had come and beheld
there in the dim shadow at the foot of the lofty granite
ledge a shapeless black lump. She shivered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You awake?&rdquo; her father asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; And she began to climb down over the wagon
wheel.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190' name='page_190'></a>190</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Wait here. I&rsquo;ll go in first. He might be&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; But
though the rancher did not complete his sentence the
words spoken carried their own grave implication.</p>
<p>He came out again presently. Mary gazed at his
face to read from it the news it might carry, and it was
with a breath of relief she perceived that the injured man
was still alive, for her father himself appeared easier of
mind. Neither would by choice have a dead man for a
passenger on the ride home, even Ed Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s breathing, but is still unconscious,&rdquo; Johnson
declared. &ldquo;Must have got a crack in the head along with
the rest. Face is covered with dried blood. From the
stuff inside the house he must have been fixing for quite
a stay&ndash;&ndash;blankets, grub, whiskey, candles, and so on.
We&rsquo;ll eat a bite ourselves before starting back; get the
pail out of the wagon and bring some water and I&rsquo;ll make
a pot of coffee. There&rsquo;s a fireplace and wood inside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the water, but I&rsquo;ll stay out while you&rsquo;re boiling
it,&rdquo; the girl said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to see him until I have
to go in and help carry him out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She went off for the water, on her return setting the
bucket by the door. Then curious to see the place of
Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s accident, she wandered back along the
trail to the ledge. There she beheld the crumpled, fire-blackened
remains of his automobile in a heap near the
stone wall. Apparently the car had first struck a small
boulder, which had flung Sorenson out on one side and
forward, then leaping this hit the ledge full force.</p>
<p>At the instant he must have been off the road and
headed wrong, she guessed. The rapid daybreak of the
mountains had by now dispersed the last dimness and
indeed the crags far above were bright with sunshine.
She could plainly see the ruin that the machine was, fire
having completed what the smash had left undamaged,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191' name='page_191'></a>191</span>
and the part of the rock that was smoked by the flames,
and was able to smell yet the reek of burnt oil, varnish
and rubber.</p>
<p>With the eyes of the curious she stared at the wreck,
at the ledge, at the ground, absorbed with simple speculations
and filled with a sense of awe. The machine must
have made a big sound when it struck. It was a lot of
money gone quickly, that car. Not enough of it
left to make it worth hauling away. And so on and so
on.</p>
<p>Then all at once her wandering regard detected something
white in a crevice between two stones. At first she
thought it the gleam of a bird or a chipmunk. The thing
was some yards off from the spot where she stood, but
the flutter persisted. So she approached it to learn its
nature.</p>
<p>The thing was a paper. One corner of a sheet stuck
up from the crack in which it lay and was waved gently
by the rising dawn breeze. She drew it out and perceived
it was fastened to other sheets that were folded, all damp
from the rain though not soaked because the cranny had
admitted little moisture. It was the last sheet which
had come partly unfolded, apparently as it fell, so was
left in sight or she would never have noticed the white
flutter. This last sheet was blank, but the others, neatly
folded though wrinkled, were covered with writing she
saw on spreading them open. However, she could not
read the pages; the matter was typewritten, but it was
not English. Some foreign language, maybe.</p>
<p>If Mary could not read the document, she could at
least logically deduce how it had happened to be in its
present resting-place. The paper was here because the
wrecked automobile was here, so when Ed Sorenson was
pitched out the folded sheets of paper must have been
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192' name='page_192'></a>192</span>
propelled from his pocket by the same force and at the
same instant. It hit a rock after flying through the air
and slid down into the crack.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was only a business document; it looked
like one. Again perhaps it told something about his
crooked private affairs&ndash;&ndash;about his schemes for ruining
girls, possibly. Very likely, indeed. That seemed to be
about all he engaged himself at. When she found some
one who could read it, she would know for certain. She
would just take it along with her and say nothing about
her find until she could have somebody who understood
the writing read it over for her.</p>
<p>In places the typing had stained from dampness, but
not seriously. She could dry out the pages over the
kitchen stove at home. So folding the sheets again, she
doubled the document, tied it in her handkerchief and
placed it inside her waist, where it could not be lost.
Perhaps there were other papers. But a further search
disclosed none, whereupon as her father was shouting to
her from the cabin to come she retraced her steps.</p>
<p>When they had drunk their coffee and eaten some of
Sorenson&rsquo;s food, making their meal before the door, they
carried the unconscious man out to the wagon, bearing
him in the blanket on which he lay. Other blankets they
spread over him. Johnson also placed at the prostrate
figure&rsquo;s feet the rest of the eatables in the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No need to leave this stuff to the pack-rats,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll just consider it a little pay towards fetching him
out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He ought to be willing to pay you a whole lot more
when he learns the trouble you&rsquo;ve been to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t touch his money if he offered me a thousand
dollars; I&rsquo;d throw it back in his face. I&rsquo;m not
doing this for pay, or friendship, or charity; I&rsquo;m doing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193' name='page_193'></a>193</span>
it to help Janet Hosmer and because Weir asked me.
If the Sorensons had all the money on earth, they
couldn&rsquo;t give me a penny as between man and man. If
they owed it to me, that would be another matter.
They&rsquo;d pay it if I had to stick a gun down their throats
to make them come across.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need any of their money, I guess,&rdquo; Mary
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. We&rsquo;re poor but we&rsquo;re straight. So we&rsquo;re
better off than they are&ndash;&ndash;richer, if we just look at it
that way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Once during the long drive, as they neared the ranch
house, a low moan came from the form on the straw in
the wagonbed. Both Johnson and Mary looked around
quickly, then regarded each other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Beginning to suffer,&rdquo; said the parent. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a wonder
there&rsquo;s a whole bone in his body. I hope the doctor
is down below waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proved to be the case when about ten o&rsquo;clock
Johnson drove his worn-out team into his dooryard.
Weir&rsquo;s car was there and with it the engineer himself
and a young medical practitioner. Climbing up into the
wagon, the doctor made a hasty examination of the patient.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hips broken. Slight concussion of the skull, but not
dangerous,&rdquo; was his opinion. &ldquo;I shall not be able to
tell the full seriousness of his injuries until I have him
stripped on a table or bed. Probably there are other
broken bones,&ndash;&ndash;ribs or something. We must get him
down to Bowenville as quickly as possible, for his is a
bad case. But I guess if he has pulled through so far
he&rsquo;ll recover. If you&rsquo;ll drive your wagon down to the
mouth of the canyon, we&rsquo;ll transfer him to my car, which
is double seated, and then you can accompany me to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194' name='page_194'></a>194</span>
town; Mr. Weir says you are willing to go along and
help. I&rsquo;ll send you back from Bowenville.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll go along. Mary will ride down with us and
bring back the team and wagon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Strange what he was doing up there in the mountains
with an automobile alone,&rdquo; the doctor remarked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he might have wanted a day&rsquo;s fishing, or was
taking a look at cattle or range, something like that,&rdquo;
Johnson stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir said a sheepherder found him. Wasn&rsquo;t
that it, sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer turned to the rancher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that the way of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. Showed up here late and said he had found the
man and carried him into the cabin. Said his wrecked
car was still burning, so the accident couldn&rsquo;t have occurred
very long previous. Said we ought to bring
him down immediately as he was badly hurt. So I sent
word to Dr. Hosmer, and my girl and I set off at once,
the sheepherder going back with us. Said he just happened
to be looking for a stray sheep or he would never
have come on this man, as he was heading his band for
a pass to get over on the west side of the range. S&rsquo;pose
we&rsquo;ll never see him again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who this man is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;His face seems sort of familiar,&rdquo; Johnson replied,
scratching his chin. &ldquo;But he looks like a city chap, by
his clothes, what&rsquo;s left of them. No papers or anything
on him to tell his name. Might have come over the pass
himself from the other side; men go everywhere in these
hill-climbing cars they make nowadays.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Somebody will be seeking information soon and then
we&rsquo;ll know,&rdquo; the physician said. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll probably give
his name and address himself when he comes round. But
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195' name='page_195'></a>195</span>
if I&rsquo;m not mistaken he&rsquo;ll need another sort of car if he
does any moving about when he&rsquo;s out of bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking off-hand, I&rsquo;ll say he&rsquo;ll never walk again.
That&rsquo;s the way broken hips usually turn out; and if his
spine is injured, as I suspect, he will probably be paralyzed
from the waist down. Hard luck for a young man
like him. He&rsquo;ll wish at times he was killed outright.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unobserved by the speaker Weir and Johnson exchanged
a meaningful look. In the minds of both moved
the same thought, that Providence had punished Ed
Sorenson according to his sins and more adequately than
could man. Dreadful years were before him. He would,
in truth, wish a thousand times that he had died at the
foot of the ledge.</p>
<p>Half an hour later the visitors had departed, the
rancher going with the physician and his charge to
Bowenville, Weir returning to San Mateo. Mary had
driven the wagon up from the mouth of the canyon, unharnessed
the horses, watered and fed them, and now
was seated in the kitchen staring absently out the open
door. After so much excitement she felt distrait, depressed.</p>
<p>Finally she produced and dried the papers over the
stove, in which she had re-kindled a fire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Funny how anybody should want to talk or write
anything but English,&rdquo; she remarked to herself, gazing
at the pages.</p>
<p>She attempted to extract some sense from the strange
words. At the bottom of the last sheet she deciphered,
Felipe Martinez&rsquo; name under the notorial acknowledgment.
All at once in scanning certain lines she came
on names that were plain enough&ndash;&ndash;Sorenson, Vorse,
Burkhardt, Gordon. The last must mean Judge Gordon.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196' name='page_196'></a>196</span>
Then presently she found two more names that excited
her curiosity&ndash;&ndash;James Dent&rsquo;s and Joseph Weir&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>Springing to her feet she stared at the sheets in her
hand. For some reason or other her blood was beating
with an odd sensation of impending discovery.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why&ndash;&ndash;why&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; she stammered. &ldquo;Why, those are
the men father told about being shot, and him looking on
as a boy! This is a queer paper! I wish he were here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Possession of it gave her a feeling of uneasiness. Her
father had warned her never to speak of the matter to
any one&ndash;&ndash;and here was something about it in writing,
or so she guessed. He had said Sorenson and the other
men would kill him at once if they learned he had been
a witness. That meant they would kill her too if they
found out that she not only knew about their crime
but had this paper as well.</p>
<p>She looked about. Finally she retied the document
in a tea-towel, tight and secure, and buried it deep in
the flour barrel. They would not think of looking in
the flour. But she went to the door just the same and
gazed anxiously down the canyon as if enemies might
put their heads in sight that very minute.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h3>ANXIETIES</h3>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;My dear doctor, your talents are wasted in San
Mateo. They should be employed in the larger field of
diplomacy,&rdquo; said Steele Weir, when on his arrival from
Terry Creek he was apprised of what had occurred
during his absence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From all indications I shall have full opportunity
for their use hereafter, whatever they may be, in our own
bailiwick,&rdquo; Doctor Hosmer replied, smiling. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
more going on in our village, apparently, than in many
a small kingdom. I merely had Janet use the truth with
certain limitations, and there&rsquo;s no wiser course when
part of the facts are known. Sorenson seemed quite
satisfied with her explanation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The colloquy resulted from a meeting between Janet
and the cattleman while Weir was guiding the young
physician, summoned from Bowenville, to Johnson&rsquo;s
ranch. Sorenson had appeared at the house about ten
o&rsquo;clock that morning desiring to see the girl. They had
talked together on the veranda, where the visitor stated
he had effected a settlement and obtained an acknowledgment
from Martinez, who was trying to blackmail him
and others; that a certain paper had been prepared by
the lawyer for use in the disreputable business; that the
man had said he had asked Janet to secure it from an
old chair in his office; and he wished to learn if she had
done so.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198' name='page_198'></a>198</span></div>
<p>Janet had admitted such to be the case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was odd Mr. Martinez should telephone me to go
get it, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; she had asked. &ldquo;But I went, and
there it was stuffed in the lining of the chair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it then?&rdquo; Sorenson stated, with a sigh of
relief and his eyes kindling with eagerness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t it now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in heaven&rsquo;s name did you do with it?&rdquo; he
asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As I was coming out of Mr. Martinez&rsquo; office, there
at the door was Ed. He had seen me go in and so
stopped his car before the door; after a time he took
the paper to see what it was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you didn&rsquo;t see its contents?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; I didn&rsquo;t even open it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he has it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He had it the last I saw of the paper. He read it.
First, he was going to burn it up because it made him
angry, then he changed his mind, saying he would take
it to show to you, as he thought you would be interested.
Is there anything else you wish to know, Mr. Sorenson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where did he go from there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He drove away. From something he said, I judged
that he planned to be away from home several days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Revolting as it was to Janet to put so fair a face on
Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s conduct, nevertheless she had braced herself
to go through with the part and presented to the
cattleman a clear, natural countenance. The very simplicity
of her story, its directness, its accord with the
facts as he knew them, carried conviction. Innocently
drawn into the affair, she had, in his view, been quickly
guided out again by Ed&rsquo;s luck and wit.</p>
<p>Ed had the deadly document. The four men concerned
might breathe easily once more. Ed himself, in all
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199' name='page_199'></a>199</span>
probability, did not realize the true menace of old
Saurez&rsquo; deposition, or he would at once have brought
it to him instead of continuing on his trip: the boy no
doubt thought it sufficient to keep it until he returned
or mailed it back from somewhere; he perhaps had taken
it along for a more careful reading. Good boy, anyway.
He had got possession of the thing, that was the main
consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me too that he was leaving last evening for
a few days&rsquo; jaunt,&rdquo; Sorenson said, rising to go. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll
likely have a whole basketful of letters from him. Finest
boy going, Ed, even if it&rsquo;s his own father who says it.
But he&rsquo;s the lucky one, Janet.&rdquo; The girl lowered her
eyelids, for at this flattery she felt she could no longer
dissemble her feelings. &ldquo;Sorry to have bothered you
about the matter,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;Fellows like this
Martinez are always making us trouble. Run over and
eat dinner with us soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went down the walk, large, dominant and still with
a trace of his early cowman&rsquo;s walk. Both his step and
his erectness bespoke the buoyant effect of the talk upon
his spirits, which was not to be wondered at as he had
splendid news to import to his confr&egrave;res in crime. They
would get rid of Martinez, destroy the paper when Ed
delivered it, and their skeleton&ndash;&ndash;this one (of a number)
which had unexpectedly kicked the door open and started
to dance in public&ndash;&ndash;would be safely locked up forever.
For Saurez, the only witness (as they believed) was now
dead: he would make no more depositions. Certainly
Sorenson had reason to walk briskly away from Doctor
Hosmer&rsquo;s dwelling.</p>
<p>Janet had somberly watched him till he was out of
sight, then had gone inside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how I ever imagined him an honorable
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200' name='page_200'></a>200</span>
man,&rdquo; she said to her father. &ldquo;For all his pretended
politeness he was ready if necessary to bully me. One
thing he can&rsquo;t ever say is that I didn&rsquo;t tell him exact
facts; what I omitted was the circumstances giving rise
to the facts.&rdquo; And her father, who now knew from Weir
the story of the happening of thirty years before, assured
her that she need be troubled over no moral hairsplitting.</p>
<p>The incident, as Steele Weir perceived, diverted both
suspicion and danger from Janet, at least for a time.
A big gain that. And he was impressed by the subtle
sagacity of the maneuver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That wasn&rsquo;t just a clever move, it was a flash of genius,&rdquo;
he told father and daughter. Then after a few
minutes more of talk he said: &ldquo;Now I must be running
up to the dam. To-day is Sunday and the works are
quiet, so if I find everything all right I shall strike back
immediately for Terry Creek and the cabin up above.
I want to make a search for that paper by daylight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;After your hard night?&rdquo; Janet exclaimed. &ldquo;I
snatched some sleep when we had done talking last night,
but father says you and he had none. You can&rsquo;t make
that terrible ride again without rest!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Missing a night in bed is nothing new,&rdquo; he laughed.
&ldquo;Once or twice in my life I&rsquo;ve not had my clothes off in
a week, and only such cat-naps as I could steal meantime.
But I&rsquo;ll not boast of that; your father probably
has gone longer periods without sleep, or with only
broken rest, than ever I did. Most doctors do. Be sure
and let me know if anything new occurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But if Weir&rsquo;s mind was put at ease so far as Janet
was concerned, he had more than enough other cares
to burden his thoughts. The loss of the deposition,
chief of all; then the matter of effecting Martinez&rsquo; release,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201' name='page_201'></a>201</span>
wherever he was immured; and finally, as he
learned from Meyers and Atkinson on reaching camp,
the insidious promise of trouble in the &ldquo;free whiskey
party.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps whoever supplied the fire-water underestimated
this copper-lined crew&rsquo;s capacity and didn&rsquo;t furnish
enough,&rdquo; Meyers suggested. &ldquo;Nobody was really
drunk last night and here it is nearly noon, with the
men all hanging about camp. If there was whiskey yet
to be had, some of these thirsty, rollicking scrappers
of ours would be right back at the spigot this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so,&rdquo; Atkinson admitted. &ldquo;Seems so&ndash;&ndash;and yet
I ain&rsquo;t easy in my mind. The men don&rsquo;t act right; they
behave as if they&rsquo;re just waiting; they&rsquo;re restless and
not a man could I get to open his mouth about where
they found the stuff. If there wasn&rsquo;t to be any more,
they would have told and tried to kid me. They appear
to me as if just biding their time. Some men weren&rsquo;t
gone, of course, those who don&rsquo;t drink. They stayed in
the bunk-house and they know nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go on the supposition then that there will be
more coming, and act accordingly,&rdquo; Weir stated, at
once. &ldquo;Watch them close, and put up a warning that
men who are not at work in the morning, or who bring
booze into camp, will be fired.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the trouble,&rdquo; the superintendent declared. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think they brought a drop in except in their skins.
And as we say, they weren&rsquo;t drunk. There&rsquo;s not a thing
we can object to and they know it; somebody has put
&rsquo;em wise how to act. Here they are, sober this morning,
behaving themselves, and so on. We can&rsquo;t keep men
from going for a walk if they want to; we can&rsquo;t string
barb-wire around the camp and hold them in; we can&rsquo;t
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202' name='page_202'></a>202</span>
even say they can&rsquo;t touch a bottle if a stranger offers
them one when they&rsquo;re on the outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But we can hold up the consequences if they go on a
spree,&rdquo; Steele replied. &ldquo;Most of them are satisfied with
the work and pay and grub; they don&rsquo;t want to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, but they like whiskey too, free whiskey in particular.
They would say they&rsquo;re not getting drunk&ndash;&ndash;no
man ever really expects to when he starts drinking&ndash;&ndash;and
talk about their &lsquo;rights.&rsquo; There are two or three fellows
in camp now who are doing a lot of mouthing about
labor&rsquo;s rights; I. W. W.&rsquo;s, I&rsquo;d say. Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if they were the ring-leaders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If more whiskey comes, we must beat them to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my notion,&rdquo; Atkinson said, with a nod. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t locate the booze fountain last night, but I did
this morning. Took a horse at daylight and rode along
the hills; about a mile south in some trees at the foot
of the mountain, I came across a case of empty bottles
and a keg half-full of water. That was all, but it
showed where the &lsquo;birthday party&rsquo; was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the place to watch, then. Better send a
trusty man there to report to us immediately if he sees
signs of a supply arriving for to-night. Half a dozen
of us with axes will soon start a temperance wave in that
locality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In accordance with this instruction the superintendent
dispatched a reliable man to maintain guard at the spot;
and Weir, feeling that all had been done that was possible
under the circumstances, gave his attention to other
matters.</p>
<p>But he perceived that with this &ldquo;liquor attack&rdquo; in the
air, for it was but another of his enemies&rsquo; moves against
him, of course, directed with the purpose of creating
internal disorder, he must postpone his trip to the headwaters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203' name='page_203'></a>203</span>
of Terry Creek. Knowing the crafty, persistent,
conscienceless character of the four men inspiring the
trick, he was under no delusion that the &ldquo;free whiskey&rdquo;
would end with a single case of bottles. Among three
hundred men that would amount to but two or three
drinks apiece&ndash;&ndash;a mere taste, only a teaser. And because
it was only a teaser, the men would want more. If he
could carry them over this idle Sunday sober, they would
be at work on the morrow and the chief danger be
passed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately a manager cannot take his workmen
into his confidence in such a case and explain the nature
of such a cunning attack; the thing was too complex,
and their untutored minds would fail to perceive if
they did not actually reject the explanation, in jealousy
for their &ldquo;rights&rdquo; concluding that they were being hoodwinked.
By very perverseness they would refuse to deny
themselves a free gift of whiskey.</p>
<p>With Pollock, however, whose interest as a director
was vital, he could talk in full expectation of being understood.
And moreover, owing to the entangled condition
into which the company&rsquo;s and his own personal
affairs had come, strict honor required that he inform
his visitor of the entire situation and offer, if in the
director&rsquo;s view such action would best serve the company&rsquo;s
ends, to resign.</p>
<p>In his office immediately after dinner he gave the
easterner a complete account of happenings in San
Mateo since his arrival as manager, with a statement of
his father&rsquo;s earlier residence here, of the fraud practiced
by Sorenson and his companions on him and his tragically
ruined life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, you see, has resulted not only in bringing the
animosity of these men against me but in aggravating
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204' name='page_204'></a>204</span>
their hostility to the company,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
never been a quitter. It would go sorely against the
grain with me to quit now while under fire. But my own
feelings or fortunes should have no weight; the company&rsquo;s
interests alone are to be considered. I shall
turn over the management to Meyers and retire if you
desire; I count my contract not binding upon your board
under the circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pollock arose and began to pace the office, gently
beating the air with his eye-glasses and thoughtfully
regarding the floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should not do your remarkable story proper justice
if I did not give it the serious attention it deserves,&rdquo; he
said, after a time. &ldquo;Certain aspects of the case would
appear to favor our accepting your resignation, but on
analysis, Weir, they turn out to be aspects only, not
real arguments. Assuming the facts are as you relate,
which I personally don&rsquo;t doubt, these men, if they will
stop at nothing to injure you, will be no more reluctant
to injure us. In fact, if you withdrew they would feel
that they had gained a distinct triumph, forced us to
yield to their will, and would be inspired to further and
greater opposition. Personal hatred for you on their
part is no ground for their fixing their enmity on the
company. But that enmity, apparently, already existed
before you came. Therefore if they hate you likewise,
you and our company have a common bond. And that
assures us of one thing, or several things: your vigilance,
care of company property, and loyalty. Last, and
aside from that, you are, I am confident, possessed of
the exact qualities essential to the successful solution of
present difficulties. We prefer as manager an energetic,
determined, fighting man, however much disliked by envious
neighbors, to some fellow less firm and more inclined
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205' name='page_205'></a>205</span>
to conciliation. The latter never gained anything
with out-and-out foes, from what I&rsquo;ve seen. So you perceive,
Weir, that when my associates and I get into a
row we&rsquo;re not quitters either. We shall therefore just
dismiss all talk of your resignation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very good; I wanted you to know the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pollock paced to and fro for a time longer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What really interests me is your own fight,&rdquo; he remarked
at length. &ldquo;If the paper you spoke of should
be found, I would be pleased to have it translated for
you. I should also like to consult with this man Martinez;
he seems a clever fellow. You expect to settle with
this quartet who defrauded your father, of course.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly. But the money isn&rsquo;t the main thing. For
no amount of money would ever pay for the wrong done
my father. I want to make these men suffer, suffer as
he suffered. Call it a simple desire for revenge if you
will; that&rsquo;s what it really is. They robbed him of his
future as well as of his ranch and cattle. They took
away hope and implanted in his breast terror and remorse
wholly undeserved. But for them he might have been a
happy, prosperous, well-thought of man in this state.
Yes, revenge is what I want, not money. Revenge that
will be for them an equivalent of hell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they should pay the legal penalties of their
crime as well,&rdquo; the lawyer spoke. &ldquo;Recovery of the
original amounts gained by fraud from both your
father and this man Dent, and accumulated interest as
well as damages, should be had. In all it should make
a large amount.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose so. Probably enough to clean the four
men out. But though of course I should enjoy getting
the property or money that was rightfully my father&rsquo;s
and now mine, still I&rsquo;d let that go if I could secure the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206' name='page_206'></a>206</span>
satisfaction of making the four men pay in the coin I
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool, Weir. Don&rsquo;t overlook any bets, as
the saying is. Taking their property away from them
will but add to their pain and to your pleasure. Now
we must see if Dent&rsquo;s heirs can be found. I suggest
that you employ some good attorney to start a hunt
along that line, for an action by Dent&rsquo;s relatives will
indirectly strengthen your own case. I&rsquo;m doubtful
about one thing, however&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your courts here, and the value of this old Mexican&rsquo;s
deposition. The case could be brought in a Federal
Court as you&rsquo;re a non-resident, which would solve
the first point, but how much weight would this Mexican&rsquo;s
testimony have against white men of standing and
after a period of thirty years. If you could find another
witness&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was one, a white boy, so Martinez hinted,&rdquo;
Weir said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Find him, find him. Search the whole country until
you find him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a big undertaking, when I don&rsquo;t even know
his name or whether he&rsquo;s alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin nevertheless.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I had better find my lost paper or secure another
statement from old Saurez first. At present I have
absolutely nothing that a court would look at; I haven&rsquo;t
as much as I had yesterday. And even Martinez has
been spirited away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pollock smiled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m interested, greatly interested,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
not actively engaged in legal affairs at home and I may
stay on here awhile longer. Perhaps I can assist you;
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207' name='page_207'></a>207</span>
it promises excitement, at any rate. After dry corporation
matters, it should be a refreshing change&ndash;&ndash;and I
haven&rsquo;t had a real vacation in years. Possibly this is
the time to take one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I appreciate your kindness in speaking so, Mr. Pollock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m quite selfish; I&rsquo;m seeking entertainment.
And your peppery affairs promise it. Do you give me
permission to take a hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gladly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then as a beginning I&rsquo;ll go to town. Saurez, you
say, was the old Mexican&rsquo;s name? And give me the
facts again as you know them about the affair of your
father and the man Dent in the saloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pollock listened closely as Steele Weir repeated the
story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all I know, and it&rsquo;s meager at best,&rdquo; the engineer
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pity you didn&rsquo;t get to read the deposition, which
would have increased your fund of information. More
unfortunate it is that you haven&rsquo;t the paper itself. But
we&rsquo;ll do the best we can without it for the present. Kindly
have some one drive me in to San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Atkinson, the superintendent, is going there for
me. I thought he might pick up something of Martinez&rsquo;
whereabouts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where does Judge Gordon live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t tell you that. But you can easily learn when
you reach town.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the Judge used to handle company matters,
you know.&rdquo; The smile on Pollock&rsquo;s lips was inscrutable.
&ldquo;I used to have frequent conferences with him when I was
here at the inception of our project. He is very
shrewd in certain ways, but he impressed me as being
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208' name='page_208'></a>208</span>
not exactly&ndash;&ndash;what shall I say?&ndash;&ndash;&lsquo;cold steel&rsquo;, for instance.&rdquo;
And still wearing the thin smile, he went out.</p>
<p>If Weir had not had so many things to make his
mind grave, from a missing paper and a missing lawyer
to mysterious whiskey and fierce enemies, he would have
leaned back and laughed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h3>THE WEAK LINK</h3>
</div>
<p>Though the sun was bright that day, unseen forces
were gathering in the sky above town, mesa and mountains,
not of weather but of fate, to loose their
lightnings. Sunday peace seemed to reign, the languid
summer Sunday peace of tranquil nature. Yet even
through this there was a faint breath of impending
events, a quiver or excitement in the air, an increasing
expectation on the part of men, who sensed but did not
realize what was to come.</p>
<p>All day whispers and hints had passed among the
people in San Mateo and out to isolated farms and up
nearby creeks, kindling in the ignorant, brown-skinned
Mexicans a lively interest and an exorbitant curiosity.
Nothing was said definitely; nothing was promised outright.
So in consequence speculation ran wild and rumors
wilder. The hints had to do with the manager of
the dam who had shot the strange Mexican: something
was to be done with him, something was to happen to him.
He had been arrested, or was to be arrested; he had confessed,
or was about to confess the murder; he was going
to kill other Mexicans, or had killed other Mexicans; he
was about to raid San Mateo with his workmen and slay
the town; he was to be hanged;&ndash;&ndash;and so on eternally.
Uncertain as was everything else, what was sure apparently
was that something would happen at San Mateo
that night.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210' name='page_210'></a>210</span></div>
<p>Families visiting about in wagons spread the news.
Horsemen were at pains to ride to outlying Mexican
ranch houses, for what messenger is so welcome as he
who brings tales of great doings? He might be sure of
an audience at once. So it was that the plan craftily put
in operation by Weir&rsquo;s enemies, to gather and inflame the
people, under cover of whose pressure and excitement
when the engineer was arrested he might be slain by a
pretended rescue or popular demonstration, whichever
should serve best, produced the expected result. During
the afternoon wagons and horsemen and men on foot
began to appear in town, to join already aroused relatives
or friends at their adobe houses or to loaf along
the main street in groups.</p>
<p>Outwardly there were few signs in the aspect of the
Mexican folk of something extraordinary developing.
But to the sheriff, Madden, aroused from an afternoon
nap at his home by a telephoned message from the county
attorney requesting him to come to the court house, the
unwonted number in the town was in itself a significant
fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know this was a fiesta, Alvarez. What&rsquo;s up
with you people?&rdquo; he asked of one he met on the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fiesta is to be to-night, eh?&rdquo; the man laughed.
&ldquo;Have you this engineer locked up yet?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What engineer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The killer, the gun-man, that Weir. It is said he is
already arrested and is to be hanged from the big cottonwood
at dark beside the jail. It is also said he is
still loose and bringing five hundred workmen to burn
the town, rob the bank, kill the men and steal the girls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he is to do either, it&rsquo;s news to me,&rdquo; Madden said,
and proceeded to the office of Lucerio, the county attorney.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211' name='page_211'></a>211</span></div>
<p>Madden was a blunt man, who for policy&rsquo;s sake might
close his eyes to unimportant political influence as exercised
by the Sorenson crowd. But he was no mere
compliant tool. This was his first term in office. He had
never yet crossed swords with the cattleman and the
others associated with him, because the occasion had
never arisen. When he had allowed himself to be nominated
for sheriff, though Sorenson might imagine
Madden to be at his orders, the latter had accepted the
office with certain well-defined ideas of his duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo; he asked Lucerio, for
whom he had little liking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I desire to tell you, Madden, that at eight o&rsquo;clock
I&rsquo;ll have a warrant for you to serve on the engineer
Weir. You&rsquo;ll go to the dam and arrest him and bring
him in to the jail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, apparently the whole country except me knew
this was to happen. The town&rsquo;s filling up as if it were
going to be a bull-fight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; give me the warrant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At eight o&rsquo;clock. I don&rsquo;t want it served before then.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have my reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorenson? And Vorse and Burkhardt? They&rsquo;ve
stirred up this charge against the man.&rdquo; Lucerio making
an angry answer, he continued. &ldquo;Well, everybody
knows you jump when they pull the string. I&rsquo;ll have
to serve the warrant, naturally. But I&rsquo;m going to tell
you what I think: you&rsquo;ve faked the evidence you&rsquo;ve got;
we had the truth from Martinez and Janet Hosmer at
the inquest; you&rsquo;re trying to railroad Weir to the gallows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sorenson shall know what you&rsquo;ve said. As for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212' name='page_212'></a>212</span>
me&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;the Mexican swelled with outraged dignity&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;the
evidence was placed in my hands. It warrants the
engineer&rsquo;s arrest and trial. You attend to your department
and I&rsquo;ll attend to mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All to the good, Mr. County Attorney. I&rsquo;ll arrest
him; he won&rsquo;t make me any trouble on that score. But
you won&rsquo;t find it so easy to prove his guilt. And afterwards,
just look out, for if he doesn&rsquo;t come gunning for
you and fill your carcass full of lead, I miss my guess.
You won&rsquo;t be able to hide behind Sorenson, either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He left the county attorney at that, the latter unable
despite all his efforts to hide his uneasiness and
alarm. Madden reaching the street looked at his watch;
it was half past five, so he started home for supper.</p>
<p>Some way before him he saw Martinez walking. The
lawyer did not stop to converse with any of the loiterers
along the street, but moved steadily along. He had
come out of Vorse&rsquo;s saloon and was going towards his
office. Just then the sound of an automobile caused
Madden to turn his head in time to see Weir speed along
but stop with a sudden application of brakes as he
caught sight of the attorney.</p>
<p>A hail brought Martinez to the car. A few minutes&rsquo;
rapid speech there followed. Then the lawyer mounted
beside Weir, the machine went on, turning into a side
street and vanishing. To Madden there was nothing unusual
in the circumstance, and he only noted the surprise
and silence along the street at the engineer&rsquo;s passage.
The Mexicans would know the man wasn&rsquo;t yet arrested
at any rate, he thought. But he should like to
learn what was the purpose in bringing them all to town!
He would keep an eye open for any lynching nonsense
if it were attempted.</p>
<p>Weir and Martinez were hastening to Judge Gordon&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213' name='page_213'></a>213</span>
house, for shortly before the engineer had received an
unexpected call from Pollock for him to join him there.
Evidently the eastern lawyer had turned a card of some
sort; and Weir had gone at once, wondering what the
meeting might portend. The sight of Martinez, free and
composed of hearing, walking along the street, further
amazed him.</p>
<p>He perceived, however, when the lawyer stepped out
to the car from Vorse&rsquo;s place that he was pale, his mouth
tight-drawn and his eyes glittering.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got my message?&rdquo; the latter asked, quickly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The telephone message, yes. Janet Hosmer got the
paper also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They dragged me to Vorse&rsquo;s cellar,&rdquo; Martinez whispered
fiercely. &ldquo;They beat me with their fists, Vorse and
Burkhardt. Then they tied me and squeezed my eyeballs
till I could stand the pain no longer and told. I&rsquo;ve
been there ever since, bound and without food or water,
the devils! Sorenson came with them last night, afterwards.
And now he and Vorse came again&ndash;&ndash;there they
are back there in the bar yet&ndash;&ndash;and gave me a draft on a
Chicago bank for a thousand dollars and said to get out
and stay out of New Mexico and never open my mouth
about what had happened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get in with me,&rdquo; Weir ordered.</p>
<p>At Judge Gordon&rsquo;s house the lawyer said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are going in here? He&rsquo;s one of them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know it. Come in, however. I may need you.
You&rsquo;re not going to leave San Mateo, but there&rsquo;s no reason
why you shouldn&rsquo;t cash the draft. That&rsquo;s only part
of the damages you&rsquo;ll make them pay for what you underwent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t money I want from them,&rdquo; Martinez replied,
between his teeth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214' name='page_214'></a>214</span></div>
<p>Judge Gordon lived in a rambling adobe house two
squares from the Hosmer dwelling. It was old but had
been kept in good repair, and as he had never married
he had lived comfortably enough with an old Mexican
pair as servants. One of these, the woman, admitted the
visitors at their knock and conducted them, as if expected,
to the Judge&rsquo;s study, a long room lined with
cases of books, mostly legal, and filled with old-fashioned
furniture.</p>
<p>That something had occurred to change the Judge&rsquo;s
aspect during the hours in which Pollock had been
closeted with him was at once apparent. He looked
older, broken, haggard of face, terrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I met Mr. Martinez and brought him along,&rdquo; Weir
said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was that necessary?&rdquo; Judge Gordon asked, heavily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s my attorney, for one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ve been a prisoner in Vorse&rsquo;s cellar for twenty-four
hours for another, and you&rsquo;re one of those responsible
for my being there and for the torture to which
I was subjected,&rdquo; Martinez exclaimed, glaring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Martinez, I give you my word of honor that
I knew nothing of your incarceration until this morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That for your word of honor!&rdquo; the lawyer cried,
snapping his fingers in the air. &ldquo;And in any case, you&rsquo;re
an accessory after the fact. You let me stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pollock stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this Mr. Martinez? Glad to meet you, sir. Mr.
Weir has spoken very favorably of you and of your
handling of legal matters for the irrigation company, of
which I am a director. Pollock is my name. Are you a
notary? Ah, that is good. There will be some papers
to acknowledge and witness and so on.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215' name='page_215'></a>215</span></div>
<p>He pointed at seats, seemingly having direction of
matters, and the visitors sat down. Judge Gordon had
sagged down in the padded leather chair in which
he sat; his face was colorless, his eyes moving aimlessly
to and fro, his white mustache and hair in disorder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us begin on business at once,&rdquo; Pollock stated, on
his feet as was usual when entering a discussion and
removing his eye-glasses. &ldquo;I called on Judge Gordon
this afternoon after my talk with you, Weir, and disclosed
the evidence which has been gathered relative to
the fraud perpetrated on your father and the crime
against the man Dent. I assumed, and rightly, that to a
man of the Judge&rsquo;s legal mind the facts we hold would
prove the futility of resistance, and I set out to convince
him of the wisdom of sparing himself a long losing
fight, in which he would be opposing not only the evidence
which was sure to convict him, and not only you,
Mr. Weir, but our company which proposed to see the
fight through. I went so far, Weir, as to promise him
immunity from your wrath and from public prosecution.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir arose slowly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;no.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, my dear fellow&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. He made my father&rsquo;s life a hell for thirty years.
Why should I spare him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If granting him freedom from prosecution did actually
spare him anything, I should say &lsquo;No&rsquo; also, standing
in your place. But with the facts made public as
they will be, with Judge Gordon losing his legislative
office and the esteem in which he had been held, with him
relinquishing the bulk of his fortune as he agrees, with
his finding it necessary to go elsewhere to live at his time
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216' name='page_216'></a>216</span>
of life, with the thought constantly in his mind of how
low he has been brought, don&rsquo;t you think he will be suffering
quite adequately? I should think so. He would
probably die quicker in prison, but I believe he will suffer
more outside. See, I don&rsquo;t hesitate to measure the alternatives,
for the Judge and I have discussed and canvassed
the whole situation, which was necessary, of course, in
order to arrive at a clear understanding.&rdquo; And Pollock
smiled genially.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does he admit my charges?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t denied them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will he admit them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve outlined exactly what we must have&ndash;&ndash;deeds to
his property and an acknowledged statement of the
Joseph Weir and James Dent affair, supplementing the
Saurez affidavit, which by the way he at first thought
we did not possess but which an account of what happened
last night in the mountains and your recovery of
the same&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;Pollock&rsquo;s eyelid dropped for an instant
towards Weir&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;convinced him of. This statement is
not to be produced as evidence against his associates
except in the last extremity, and if not needed is always
to be kept secret. We are to give him, when the papers
are signed, a draft for ten thousand dollars. This will
permit him to have something to live on. He states that
he will want to go from San Mateo at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this speech Weir&rsquo;s eyes had glanced to and
fro between the lawyer ticking off his words with his
glasses and the figure in the leather chair. Old and
shattered as Judge Gordon had suddenly become,
wretched as Weir saw him to be, the engineer nevertheless
felt no pity. The man had been in the conspiracy that
had ruined his father; he suffered now not because of
remorse but through fear of public opinion; and was a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217' name='page_217'></a>217</span>
fox turned craven because he found himself enmeshed
in a net. And to save his own skin he was selling out
his friends.</p>
<p>Weir&rsquo;s face went dark, but Pollock quickly stepped
forward and drew him into a corner of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep calm, man,&rdquo; was the lawyer&rsquo;s low advice. &ldquo;Do
you think if we had him tied up as tightly as I&rsquo;ve made
him believe that I should propose a compromise in his
case. He&rsquo;s the weak link. Do you think I&rsquo;ve had an
easy time the last three hours bringing him to the point
he&rsquo;s at? I had to invent evidence that couldn&rsquo;t possibly
exist. I had to give him a merciless mental &lsquo;third degree.&rsquo;
I told him if he refused I was going to Sorenson with
the same offer, who would jump at the chance. And, my
dear man, we haven&rsquo;t, in reality, enough proof to convict
a mouse since you lost that paper. So now, so far as
he&rsquo;s concerned, you must bend a little, a very little&ndash;&ndash;and
you&rsquo;ll be able to hang the remaining three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This incisive reasoning was not to be denied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I yield,&rdquo; said Weir.</p>
<p>Beaming, Mr. Pollock walked back to the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir consents,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;Mr. Martinez, if
you will go to your office and bring the necessary forms
and your seal we can make the transfers and statement
and wind the matter up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An hour later Judge Gordon had signed the deeds,
stock certificates from his safe and bills of sale spread
before him, passing the ownership of lands, cattle and
shares in companies to Pollock for equitable division
between Weir and the Dent heirs if found. The old
Mexican servants were called in and witnessed his shaky
signatures to the papers.</p>
<p>At the statement regarding the Dent shooting and
Weir fraud, which Pollock had dictated to Martinez with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218' name='page_218'></a>218</span>
Gordon&rsquo;s assistance, he staggered to his feet while the
pen dropped from his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sign it, I can&rsquo;t sign it; they would kill me!&rdquo; he
groaned.</p>
<p>The two aged servants stared at him wonderingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Judge, they&rsquo;ll never know of it until it&rsquo;s
too late for them to do anything&ndash;&ndash;if they ever know,&rdquo;
came the easterner&rsquo;s words, in smooth persuasiveness.</p>
<p>Judge Gordon brushed a hand over his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me a moment,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>He stood for a time motionless. Then he walked across
the room and opened a door and entered an inner chamber.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t live a year after this,&rdquo; Pollock whispered
to his companions.</p>
<p>The speaker could have shortened the time immensely
and have still been safe in his prophecy. For when at the
end of five minutes he sent the woman to request the
Judge to return, she stumbled out of the bed-chamber
with affrighted eyes. She said the Judge was asleep on
his bed and could not be aroused.</p>
<p>Sleep of the profoundest, the men discovered on going
in. And in his fingers was an empty vial. So far as
Judge Gordon was concerned Weir had had his revenge.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h3>AN OLD ADOBE HOUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Revenge Weir had. But even in death Judge Gordon,
true to his evasive, contriving character, had tricked
him; and the irony lay in the fact that in this last act
the trick was unpremeditated, unconscious, unintentional.
Instead of the signed confession, necessary above everything
else, which seemed almost in his fingers, the man
had left a little poison vial.</p>
<p>Night had settled over the earth when the three men,
after directing the Mexican servants to bring the undertaker,
went out of the house, for considerable time had
been occupied in the discussion and the preparation of
papers preceding Judge Gordon&rsquo;s tragic end. With
him Mr. Pollock carried the documents pertaining to the
property restitution. These, considered in connection
with the suicide, would constitute something like a confession,
he grimly asserted.</p>
<p>Avoiding the main street of San Mateo they drove out
of the town for camp. The first part of the ride was
pursued in silence, for each was busy with his own
thoughts in consequence of the sudden shocking termination
of the meeting. When about half way to camp,
however, their attention was taken from the subject by
a sight wholly unexpected, a scene of high colors and of
a spirit that mocked at what had just happened.</p>
<p>Some way off from the road, at one side, two bonfires
burned brightly before an adobe house, the flames leaping
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220' name='page_220'></a>220</span>
upward in the darkness and lighting the long low-roofed
dwelling and the innumerable figures of persons.
At the distance the place was from the highway, perhaps
two hundred yards, one could make out only the shadowy
forms of men&ndash;&ndash;of a considerable number of men, at that.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never saw any one at that old tumble-down house
before, Martinez,&rdquo; Weir remarked, lessening the speed
of the car. &ldquo;Always supposed it empty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one does live there. The ground belongs to
Vorse, who leases it for farming to Oterez. Perhaps
Oterez is giving a party there. They are dancing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir brought the machine to a full stop, with suspicion
rapidly growing in his mind. The place was
owned by Vorse, for one thing, and the number about the
house was too large for an ordinary Mexican family
merry-making, for another. In view of what had occurred
the previous night all &ldquo;parties&rdquo; in the neighborhood
of the dam deserved inquiry, and this house was but
a mile from camp.</p>
<p>They could now hear the sound of music, the shrill
quick scrap of a pair of fiddles and the notes of guitars.
Against the fire-light too they could distinguish the whirl
of skirts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just run over there, will you, Martinez, and have a
look at that dance?&rdquo; Weir said. &ldquo;See how much whiskey
is there, and who the people are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mexican jumped down, climbed through the barb-wire
fence bordering the field and disappeared towards
the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you about some one giving the men booze last
night,&rdquo; the engineer addressed his remaining companion.
&ldquo;We found the place off south along the hills where that
business happened, and stationed a man there to warn
us if another attempt was made to use the spot. But I
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221' name='page_221'></a>221</span>
shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if this is the location used for
to-night; it has all the signs. We suspected that this
evening would be the real blow-out and if the men are
going there I shall send down the foremen and engineers
to break it up. Vorse&rsquo;s owning this house and his being
the source of the liquor is almost proof. I met Atkinson
returning to the dam when you sent him back from town
and he&rsquo;ll know something is up if the workmen have been
melting away from camp. This is simply another damnably
treacherous move of the gang against us to interfere
with our work, starting a big drunk and perhaps a
row. We&rsquo;ll stop it right at the beginning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are the officials of this county so completely under
Sorenson and his crowd&rsquo;s thumbs that they won&rsquo;t move
in a case like this?&rdquo; Pollock questioned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we must act on our own initiative, as you say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s our only recourse. Giving whiskey isn&rsquo;t actually
an illegal act&ndash;&ndash;and they&rsquo;re giving it away, not
trying to sell it here without a government licence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The thing&rsquo;s illegal if it&rsquo;s part of a conspiracy to disrupt
our work, and if we can secure proof that such is
the fact it will but add one more item to the score to be
settled with these San Mateo outlaws.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are more men going there. See them?&rdquo; Weir
asked. &ldquo;You hear them on the road ahead of us.
They&rsquo;re ducking through the fence and crossing to the
house. Our workmen. The thing&rsquo;s plain now; they had
word there would be another &lsquo;party&rsquo; to-night, but they
didn&rsquo;t know just where until they received word this
evening. I suppose the whole camp except a few men
will be here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Won&rsquo;t they turn ugly if you interfere?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t help that. I&rsquo;ll send men down with axes and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222' name='page_222'></a>222</span>
when the booze is poured on the ground it makes no difference
then; the men will be kept sober. If they are
stubborn, I&rsquo;ll run a new bunch in and fire these fellows.
But I don&rsquo;t imagine they will quit work, however surly,
for they know whiskey&rsquo;s no excuse. Men usually cool
down after a night&rsquo;s sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From where they sat and since Weir had turned out
his car lamps, they could see the steady string of men
emerging from the darkness of the field and approaching
the house, to quickly dissolve in the gathering already
there. In their lively steps, as well as in the eager
voices occasionally raised along the dark road, the men&rsquo;s
desire to join in the debauch was apparent.</p>
<p>With the swelling of the crowd the scraping of the
fiddles became louder, the dancing more furious, shouts
and yells more frequent, while a dense line of men passing
and jamming in and out of the door pointed only too
plainly that inside the house liquor flowed. This would
be no matter of a few drinks per man, but a big drunk
if not stopped.</p>
<p>Martinez confirmed this opinion on his return.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are two barrels inside and a couple of fellows
are dipping it up in tin cups like water,&rdquo; said he.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re not even troubling to draw the stuff; the barrels
have been placed on end and the heads knocked out.
It will be the biggest spree San Mateo ever saw, with
plenty of fighting after awhile. Women, you know, always
start fights during a spree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Those surely are not women from town,&rdquo; Weir exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no. I never saw them before. Brought in here
from somewhere&ndash;&ndash;Santa F&eacute; perhaps, El Paso more
likely. You know the kind who would mix with that
crowd&ndash;&ndash;tough girls. They&rsquo;re wearing low necks and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223' name='page_223'></a>223</span>
short skirts, red stockings and all that. You know the
kind. Out of joints and dives somewhere. There&rsquo;s only
a dozen, but they keep circulating and dancing with different
ones. I just put my head through a window to
look inside, which is lighted by a big kerosene lamp
hanging from the roof; and I tell you, gentlemen, it made
me sick the way those two fellows were dipping up whiskey
and the crowd drinking it down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more men coming all the time,&rdquo; Weir stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And more coming, yes. It will be very bad there by
midnight. Vorse and Burkhardt and Sorenson are managing
the thing, of course.&rdquo; Martinez lighted a cigarette
and stepped into the car. &ldquo;No mistake about that,
for Vorse&rsquo;s bartender is one of the men at the barrels.
And I imagine Judge Gordon knew this thing was coming
off though he made no mention of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since we were ignorant of the matter, he naturally
wouldn&rsquo;t inform us,&rdquo; Pollock remarked, dryly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time to put a stop to the show before it grows
bad,&rdquo; Weir stated resolutely. And he started the machine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it can be stopped,&rdquo; Martinez replied.</p>
<p>That was the question, whether or not now it would
be possible even to reach and destroy the barrels inside
the house, what with the numbers who would oppose the
move and what with the state of intoxication that must
rapidly prevail at the place.</p>
<p>For as they drove away they could already detect in
the mad revel about the old adobe dwelling a faster beat
in the sharp shrieking music, a wilder abandon in the
movements of the figures about the flames, a more reckless,
fiercer note in the cries and oaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is deviltry wholesale,&rdquo; Pollock said. &ldquo;On a
grand scale, one might put it.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224' name='page_224'></a>224</span></div>
<p>So thought a horseman who approached and halted
almost at the same spot where the car had rested. This
was Madden who with a warrant for Weir&rsquo;s arrest in
his pocket had arrived opposite the house a moment
after the automobile&rsquo;s departure. He had secured the
warrant at eight o&rsquo;clock according to the county attorney&rsquo;s
request, but he had taken his own time about
setting off to serve it.</p>
<p>For a quarter of a mile he had been interested in the
evidences of unwonted hilarity at the usually untenanted
structure. Now he sat in his saddle, silent and motionless,
observing the distant scene. He easily guessed the
men were from the construction camp and that liquor
was running.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can almost smell it here, Dick,&rdquo; he addressed his
horse.</p>
<p>But two circumstances puzzled him. One was that
there had been no news in town of such a big affair impending
for the night; the second, that there were
women present&ndash;&ndash;for no Mexican, however ignorant,
would take or allow his women folks to attend such a
howling show. Coming on top of the crowd in town, he
wondered if this business might not be linked up with
Weir&rsquo;s affairs. These were his workmen and this was
Vorse&rsquo;s farm-house and very likely Vorse&rsquo;s liquor. After
he had arrested the engineer he would look into the thing.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, when he had gone on, other
passers-by paused for a minute on the road to stare at
the amazing picture across the field. These were Dr.
Hosmer and Janet, Johnson and his daughter Mary: the
two men being in the doctor&rsquo;s car, the two girls in Janet&rsquo;s
runabout.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth is going on there!&rdquo; Janet exclaimed,
when the two machines had pulled up.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225' name='page_225'></a>225</span></div>
<p>The two fires, fed by fresh fuel, were leaping higher
than ever, bringing out in strong relief the long squat
building, the dark, restless, noisy throng, and the space
of illuminated earth. Against the night the flames and
building and mob of hundreds of men seemed a crimson
vision from some inferno to an accompaniment of mad
music.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp&rsquo;s gone on a tear; drive ahead,&rdquo; her father
said. &ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t a sight for you girls to look at.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the two cars sped forward towards
the dam, where on this night so much was converging.
For their occupants already had had an experience that
had started them at once to seek the man around whose
figure were swirling a hundred passions and dark currents
of destiny.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h3>WITH FANGS BARED</h3>
</div>
<p>That Sunday afternoon Janet Hosmer had awakened
about sunset from an after-dinner sleep, rested and refreshed,
with her mind continuing to be occupied by
thoughts of Steele Weir about whom had eddied her
dreams. The man was no longer the mystery he had
been, since now she knew all the circumstances of his
life, and on that account was nearer, more human, and
yet as compelling.</p>
<p>That on his part his interest went beyond mere friendship
she had recognized from his voice and eyes when
they were together. Ah, in truth, how his tones deepened
and his look betrayed his feelings! At the thought
Janet&rsquo;s heart beat faster and her cheeks grew warm and
an indefinable joy seemed to fill her breast. She would
not deny it: his presence, his touch gave her a greater
happiness than she had ever known. At a single stride,
as it were, he had come into the middle of her life and
dominated her mind and changed her whole outlook.</p>
<p>How he too had changed and grown in the coming!
From the avaricious, calculating, heartless manager of
the construction work, as she seeing through colored
San Mateo eyes had believed him to be, he now stood
forth a figure of power, undaunted by difficulties, undismayed
by enemies however numerous, fearless to a
fault, stern perhaps&ndash;&ndash;but who would not have been made
stern in his place?&ndash;&ndash;and determined, cool, resourceful,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227' name='page_227'></a>227</span>
alert, and of an integrity as firm and upright as a
marble shaft. Yet beneath this exterior his heart was
quick and tender for those who needed sympathy or
help, and his hand swift to aid.</p>
<p>More than once a hot flush burned on Janet&rsquo;s face,
as sitting there on the vine-hung veranda in the gathering
dusk, recollection assailed her with memories of
wasted kindnesses given the infamous Ed Sorenson, of
trust bestowed and of love plighted. That passage in
her life seemed to leave her contaminated forever. It
burned in her soul like a disgrace or a dishonorable act.
But Steele Weir&ndash;&ndash;and she swam in glorious ether at the
thought&ndash;&ndash;did not appear to view it in that light.</p>
<p>Juanita running in the twilight to the house interrupted
her introspection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came to tell you,&rdquo; the Mexican girl exclaimed
panting before Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what?&rdquo; For Juanita&rsquo;s reappearance in itself
was unusual, as Sunday afternoon and evening were her
own to spend at home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People are saying Mr. Weir is to be arrested and
hanged from a tree in the court house yard! Everybody
has come to town to see. Three uncles and aunts and
nine cousins of ours have already come to our house
from where they live four miles down the river. All the
town is talking about it. But though I said nothing, I
knew how Mr. Weir had saved you and that he had done
nothing to be hanged for. If anybody is to be killed it
ought to be that Ed Sorenson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you sure of this, Juanita?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, Miss Janet. It is so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this is part of the plot against him; let me
think. They might arrest him but they would never dare
try to hang him, unless they could pretend&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228' name='page_228'></a>228</span></div>
<p>What they might pretend Janet never stated, as at
that instant a motor car dashed up and stopped before
the gate. Even in the gloom she made out that the
figure garbed in a gray dust coat was Sorenson&rsquo;s.
Springing out of the machine, he jerked the gate open
and strode towards the house, while a premonition of
a fresh and unpleasant turn of affairs quivered in Janet&rsquo;s
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve come back again, you see,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Step inside
where you can hear what I have to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were like an order; the man&rsquo;s manner, indeed,
was overbearing and brutal. But the girl concealing
her resentment, preceded him into the house and
bade Juanita light a lamp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now you get out!&rdquo; Sorenson commanded the
servant in so savage a tone that she fled to the kitchen
without waiting to consult Janet&rsquo;s eyes. &ldquo;I see your
father isn&rsquo;t here,&rdquo; he continued, addressing Janet.</p>
<p>The latter made no reply. To be sure, Dr. Hosmer
was not in the room but he was in the house, sleeping.
Let the cattleman think him absent if he wished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So much the better; if he&rsquo;s not about, he won&rsquo;t try
to interfere,&rdquo; the man went on. &ldquo;Now, my girl, I&rsquo;ve
learned all about your tricks, and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, you talk like that to me in my own house!&rdquo;
Janet broke in, with a flash of eyes. &ldquo;You will walk
out of that door this instant and never set foot here
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will I, you slippery young Jezebel? I&rsquo;ll do nothing
of the kind until I&rsquo;m ready, which will be when you&rsquo;ve
handed over that paper. Don&rsquo;t try to deny that you
have it or Weir has it; I suppose he has now, and I&rsquo;ll
be forced to go shoot him down as he deserves. But I
came here first to make sure. It would be just like the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229' name='page_229'></a>229</span>
rest of the schemes of you two to have you keep it, thinking
I&rsquo;d be fooled. I have half a notion to wring your
white neck for lying to me to-day&ndash;&ndash;lying, while all the
time you knew my son was hanging between life and
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So savage was his voice, so threatening his visage and
air that Janet retreated a step. His hands worked as
if he actually felt her soft throat in his clutch; his huge
body and big beefy head swayed towards her ominously;
while his eyes carried a baleful light that revealed in full
intensity the man&rsquo;s real brutal soul. Hitherto carefully
coated in an appearance of respectability fitted to a
station of wealth, influence and prominence, he now stood
as he truly was, domineering, repellant, lawless. Janet
could at that minute measure the close kinship of father
and son.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunately a man in Bowenville recognized Ed, or
I should never have known he had been injured,&rdquo; Sorenson
went on. &ldquo;So your little scheme to keep me in ignorance
went wrong. The doctor &rsquo;phoned me about five
and I took my wife and we rushed there, and I have just
this instant returned. Do you know what the doctor
says? Ed will live, but be a life cripple, a useless wreck,
a bundle of smashed bones, always sitting in a chair, always
eating out his heart. And all because of you and
that engineer! Ed was conscious; he told me the real
story about which you lied,&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not lie,&rdquo; Janet stated, firmly.</p>
<p>Sorenson made an angry gesture as if to sweep aside
this declaration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He told me how you promised to slip away with him
to spend a week in the mountains, and how you warned
this Weir so that the two of you could trick my son and
get him out of the way. You, who always pretended to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230' name='page_230'></a>230</span>
be so innocent and virtuous! And then Weir caused the
accident up there in the hills that has crippled my boy
for life! Did it to get him out of the path to you, and
you helped, like the traitress you are; and the two of
you took the paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s form had stiffened at these insulting speeches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your son is the liar,&rdquo; said she. &ldquo;Did he tell you how
he flung a blanket over my head as Juanita and I were
coming out of Martinez&rsquo; office? How he tied my hands
and feet and carried me off like a victim&ndash;&ndash;and victim he
intended me to be! Yes, Mr. Weir rescued me because
Juanita met and told him what had happened and he
followed. Your son was drunk. He tried to commit a
crime because I had rejected him a week before, on learning
that during our engagement he had endeavored to
mislead another girl. A drunkard and a criminal both,
that&rsquo;s your son. And he alone brought on his accident
by his drunken, reckless driving. Now I&rsquo;ve told you the
truth; leave the house!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t put that kind of a story over on me,&rdquo; he
snarled. &ldquo;I believe what Ed said. Even if he has had
affairs with other girls, that makes no difference now.
You tried to double-cross him; you&rsquo;ve wrecked his body
and life; and you shall pay for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of the pair in their intense excitement had
heard a wagon drive to a stop before the house. Whether
in fact they would have heard a peal of thunder might be
a question. Sorenson, enraged by his son&rsquo;s injury and
burning for revenge, was oblivious to all else but his
passion, while Janet Hosmer, divided between contempt
and fear, had but the single thought of ridding herself
of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot injure me,&rdquo; she said, in reply to his savage
utterance.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231' name='page_231'></a>231</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll drive you and your father out of this town and
this state,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;They shall know here in San
Mateo, and wherever you go if it&rsquo;s in my power to reach
there, what sort of a pretending, double-faced, disreputable
wanton&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You coward!&rdquo; Janet burst out.</p>
<p>Then she turned to flee out of the room to arouse her
father. But Sorenson was too quick for her; he sprang
forward and seized one of her wrists.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t, you perfumed wench!&rdquo; he growled.</p>
<p>A scream formed on Janet&rsquo;s lips. The heavy, rage-crimsoned
face bent over her as if to kill her by its very
nearness. Brute the man was, and as a brute he appeared
determined she should feel his power. She pulled
back, jerking to free herself, and shrieked.</p>
<p>Intervention came from an unexpected quarter. Rushing
into the room came the rancher Johnson, followed by
his daughter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let go of her,&rdquo; the man ordered, harshly.</p>
<p>Sorenson looked about over his shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep out of this, and get out,&rdquo; he answered.</p>
<p>Johnson leaped forward and struck the other on the
jaw. The cattleman releasing his hold on Janet staggered
back, at the same time thrusting a hand under
his coat.</p>
<p>But the rancher&rsquo;s pistol was whipped forth first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;d try that game, would you?&rdquo; Johnson said, with
his ragged beard out-thrust and stiff. &ldquo;Put up your
hands; I want to see how they look sticking up over
your head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson though now holding them in sight did not
at once comply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson, you&rsquo;re butting into something that doesn&rsquo;t
concern you,&rdquo; he said, endeavoring to speak calmly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232' name='page_232'></a>232</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made one mistake in striking me; don&rsquo;t make another
by keeping that gun pointed at my head. Remember
I&rsquo;ve a mortgage on your place that you&rsquo;ll wish renewed
one of these days.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The expression of scorn on the rancher&rsquo;s face was
complete.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Trying that line, are you?&rdquo; he sneered. &ldquo;Think you
can play the money-lender now and scare me? You
didn&rsquo;t look much like a banker reaching for your gun;
you just looked like a killer then, a plain bar-room killer&ndash;&ndash;but
I beat you to the draw. You&rsquo;ve got fat and slow,
haven&rsquo;t you, since early days when you use to put lead
into poor devils whose stuff you wanted. And you didn&rsquo;t
look like a banker to me, either, trying to bulldoze Janet
when I came in; you looked like the big dirty coward you
are. Aha, here&rsquo;s the doctor! Now just tell him how it
comes you can order me out of his house, and why you
were threatening Janet and making her scream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The physician turned a white, angry countenance to
Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I heard the scream. Is it true you were abusing my
daughter?&rdquo; he demanded, stepping in front of the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I came here because I learned my son Ed had been
broken to bits through her trickery and damnable&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words were cut off by the doctor&rsquo;s hand which
smote the blasphemous lips uttering them.</p>
<p>Even more than Johnson&rsquo;s blow did this slap upon
the mouth enrage the cattleman. His face became congested,
his shoulders heaved, but behind the doctor was
the revolver still directed at his head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve come here uninvited and you&rsquo;ve said too
much,&rdquo; Doctor Hosmer stated in cold even tones. &ldquo;You
may be the town magnate, but you&rsquo;re only a ruffian and a
crook after all. You can&rsquo;t bluff or bully us. More than
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233' name='page_233'></a>233</span>
that, you&rsquo;ve insulted my daughter and me beyond any
future reparation. As for your son, he got less than he
deserved.&rdquo; He turned to the rancher. &ldquo;You came just
in time, it seems. Please see that he leaves the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Johnson waved with his gun significantly towards the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Move right along lively,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll go
along with you to see that you don&rsquo;t hamstring my
horses, which I don&rsquo;t put past an underhanded cattle-thief
like you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson seemed striving for words that would adequately
blast those before him, but they appeared lacking.
With a last malignant glare he walked out upon
the veranda and down across the yard, with his guard
following him.</p>
<p>When Johnson returned after Sorenson&rsquo;s departure
in his car, he was grinning sardonically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t want him running among my cattle; he&rsquo;d
bite &rsquo;em and give &rsquo;em the rabies,&rdquo; he remarked.</p>
<p>Janet caught and pressed his toil-roughened hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll never know how much I thank you for coming
in just when you did,&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw, your father would have showed up and
stopped him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. Father has no weapon, and that
man did have one. It was the sight of your pistol that
made him cower. You couldn&rsquo;t have chosen a more
lucky minute to arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was a little bit timely, as it turned out.
Considering too that we were coming to see you anyway,
it was just as well to walk in when we could do some good.
Mary has something for you to read, if you read Spanish.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234' name='page_234'></a>234</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good. Show &rsquo;em what you have, daughter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mary drew a knotted handkerchief from her bosom and
undid the knots. Appeared the doubled paper she had
found. This she passed to Janet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&ndash;&ndash;why, this is the document I had!&rdquo; the latter
exclaimed, joyfully. &ldquo;Where did you find it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up by the smashed automobile, when father and I
were at the cabin.&rdquo; She exchanged a guarded look with
her father. &ldquo;There are names in it that made me think
it might be valuable. So when father came back from
Bowenville I showed it to him. But neither of us could
read it. We thought we&rsquo;d better bring it to you to
read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is valuable, very valuable. I had it when I was
seized by Ed Sorenson and he took it away from me.
Evidently, then, it fell from his pocket at the time of
the accident. Yes, indeed, it&rsquo;s important. It means
everything to certain parties. I&rsquo;ll read it, but you understand
what it tells is private at present.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand&ndash;&ndash;and I think I know what it&rsquo;s going
to say,&rdquo; Johnson remarked, grimly.</p>
<p>Thereupon while the others listened Janet read a
translation of the long document. To her and her father
the facts were not new, for Weir had already related such
as he knew of the happenings in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon on that
eventful day thirty years previous. Nor for that matter
were they strange to Johnson and his daughter, though
of course neither Janet nor her father were aware of
the rancher&rsquo;s more intimate knowledge of the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A pretty good story as far as it goes, but like all
lawyers&rsquo; papers long-winded,&rdquo; Johnson stated, critically.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean, far as it goes?&rdquo; Janet asked,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235' name='page_235'></a>235</span>
curiously. &ldquo;Did you know this old Mexican? Did you
ever hear him tell about the thing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knew he was there at the time, but he never told me
anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Dr. Hosmer spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saurez died yesterday. It must have been shortly
after he made this deposition. He died in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon,
which gives a color of suspicion to his death. In
addition, Martinez, as you know, was dragged away
somewhere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then Vorse learned old Saurez had blabbed, and
killed him,&rdquo; Johnson said, in a convinced tone. &ldquo;Vorse
is a bad bird, I want to say. But so are all of them,
Sorenson, Burkhardt and Judge Gordon as well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet brought the talk back to the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You make me still wonder, Mr. Johnson,&rdquo; she said.
&ldquo;You seemed to think there&rsquo;s more to the account than is
told in this paper.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again the rancher and his daughter glanced at each
other, hesitatingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell them, father,&rdquo; Mary broke forth all at once.
&ldquo;They know this much, and you know you can trust
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, however, shook his head with a certain
dogged purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If this is just a paper in some trifling lawsuit or
other, it will be better if I keep my own counsel,&rdquo; he
stated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve riled Sorenson considerable as it is now,
and I don&rsquo;t care particularly about having him gunning
on my trail active-like. If it really mattered&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does matter; it matters everything,&rdquo; Janet cried,
&ldquo;if you really know something more!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because it concerns Mr. Weir. The Joseph Weir
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236' name='page_236'></a>236</span>
described and named in this affidavit was his father.
He believes these men robbed his father; this paper
proves it, but not absolutely, for Mexican evidence here
in this country doesn&rsquo;t carry as much weight against
white men&ndash;&ndash;especially men as rich and strong as these
named&ndash;&ndash;as it would in other places perhaps. You know
that. This paper was obtained for Mr. Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho, so that&rsquo;s the way of it!&rdquo; Johnson said, with a
long drawn-out tone.</p>
<p>He regarded the paper in silence for a time, busy with
his thoughts, absently twisting his beard, until at length
a look of satisfaction grew on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, this is fine,&rdquo; he went on presently. &ldquo;I
never thought I should be able to pay the obligation I
owe him, and I won&rsquo;t fully at that, but this will help.
No, that paper doesn&rsquo;t tell all, for I reckon Saurez didn&rsquo;t
see all.&rdquo; He glanced triumphantly at the doctor and the
girl. &ldquo;But I did.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You!&rdquo; both exclaimed.</p>
<p>But before he could explain, the memory of the cattleman&rsquo;s
threat recurred to Janet to banish thoughts
of aught else than Weir&rsquo;s danger from her mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sorenson said he was going up to the dam to
shoot Mr. Weir,&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;We must give warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did he say he was going himself?&rdquo; Johnson asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To get the paper, yes.&rdquo; Then Janet continued anxiously.
&ldquo;But the paper isn&rsquo;t all. His son told him
what occurred in the mountains and I believe the man
wants to harm Mr. Weir as well as to obtain the paper.
Perhaps he plans on gaining the document first, then
killing him. In any case, we must put Mr. Weir on
guard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll just drive up there and tell the engineer,&rdquo; Johnson
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237' name='page_237'></a>237</span>
stated. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised if I got a chance
yet to use my gun. You girls can stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet gazed at him with a flushing face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The man could go to the dam and kill Mr. Weir and
get safely home while you&rsquo;re starting with your team,&rdquo;
said she. &ldquo;No, we must drive there in a car. Father,
you take Mr. Johnson in yours, and I&rsquo;ll carry Mary in
mine. We&rsquo;ll go along of course, for we&rsquo;ll not remain
here in the cottage alone with such terrible things happening
in San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And to this there was no dissent.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h3>THE ALARM</h3>
</div>
<p>At the dam Weir found Meyers and Atkinson anxiously
waiting his return. The sudden concerted melting
away of workmen from camp had been warning to his
subordinates that the danger of a general spree had
taken definite form, which the report of a pair of young
engineers confirmed when they followed a group of laborers
to the old adobe house and beheld the beginning
of the debauch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get out all the staff, Meyers, and you, Atkinson, all
the foremen and sober men left, then go down the road
and put that joint out of business, taking axes and whatever
is necessary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if they fight?&rdquo; Meyers asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Try first to placate them. If that fails, some of you
draw them off in order to permit the others to enter the
house and destroy the whiskey. It&rsquo;s a tough job, but
you may succeed. If the crowd turns ugly as it may,
being drunk, come back. No need to take the risk of
broken heads or being beaten up. See, however, if you
can&rsquo;t outwit the outfit. Possibly you could push that
mud house over from the rear by means of a beam; that
would do the business. I leave it to you to decide what&rsquo;s
best to do, men, after you&rsquo;ve examined the situation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The camp will be unguarded except for you and the
two men with you,&rdquo; Weir&rsquo;s assistant suggested. &ldquo;If
the crowd drinking down at that place should take the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239' name='page_239'></a>239</span>
notion to come here and tear things up, there would be
nothing to hinder them. A few should stay, anyway,
I imagine&ndash;&ndash;half a dozen, who can use guns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, pick out six to remain,&rdquo; the other agreed.</p>
<p>For Meyers&rsquo; suggestion had raised a disagreeable possibility.
It was never safe to ignore precautions when a
gang of two or three hundred rough, active laborers,
however loyal when sober, were made irresponsible and
crazy by liquor; and one stage of drunkenness in such
men was usually manifested in a wild desire for violence.
The scheme of Weir&rsquo;s enemies might comprise using this
very act for wrecking the camp.</p>
<p>Six men, to be sure, would offer little resistance to
stemming the movement once it was started, but the sight
of steel in the guards&rsquo; hands might cause even a reckless
mob to pause long enough for an appeal. If the men
should be brought to listen, they could probably be diverted
from their purpose, as impassioned crowds are
easily swayed by men of force.</p>
<p>In any case the camp and dam should be defended to
the last. That went without saying.</p>
<p>Meyers and Atkinson had little more than departed
with their muster of engineers, foremen and sober workmen,
some fifty in all, when the two cars driven by Dr.
Hosmer and Janet arrived at headquarters. To the occupants
of both machines the camp appeared singularly
dark and silent, the office building and the commissary
shack alone showing lights.</p>
<p>The four visitors entered the main room in the former
building, where they found Mr. Pollock and Martinez.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir stepped out for a moment to make a round
of the camp and the horse corrals,&rdquo; the easterner replied
in answer to an inquiry from the doctor. &ldquo;Will you be
seated?&rdquo; And he politely placed chairs for Janet and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240' name='page_240'></a>240</span>
Mary, while his look scrutinized the party with discreet
interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Martinez, you&rsquo;ve escaped!&rdquo; Janet exclaimed,
after a surprised stare at the lawyer.</p>
<p>The Mexican smiled, bowed and drew one point of his
black mustache through his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed, Miss Janet,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Not without
an unpleasant experience, however. I understand you
secured the paper concerning which I telephoned you,
and though I understand it has since been lost&ndash;&ndash;through
no fault of yours&ndash;&ndash;I desire to express my thanks for
your excellent assistance in the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it has been found again; we have it with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martinez gave a start, none the less sincere for being
dramatic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Saurez&rsquo; deposition? Weir thought it
burned. Why, this is the most wonderful luck in the
world! It gives us the whip-hand again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mary Johnson here found it in a crack in the rocks
when she and her father went up to the cabin to bring
Ed Sorenson down. Father has it. That&rsquo;s one reason
we&rsquo;re here. But there&rsquo;s another; Mr. Sorenson has
learned of his son&rsquo;s accident, has seen him, talked with
him, been told lies and now is in a dreadful rage, threatening
every one concerned. He was at our house and
made a scene. He&rsquo;s coming here, or so he said, to kill
Mr. Weir and obtain the document. So we hurried to
the dam to give warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this juncture Mr. Pollock stepped forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Sorenson hasn&rsquo;t yet appeared, and I assure you
he will be prevented from harming any one if he comes.
You are Miss Janet Hosmer, I judge, of whom I&rsquo;ve
heard so much that is praiseworthy. Will you allow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241' name='page_241'></a>241</span>
me to introduce myself? I&rsquo;m Mr. Pollock, a company
director, and to a degree in Mr. Weir&rsquo;s confidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet expressed her pleasure at his acquaintance and
in turn introduced her father and the Johnsons.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir spoke of you to us, but we weren&rsquo;t aware
he had informed you of the paper.&rdquo; Then she added,
&ldquo;But he would wish to, naturally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir&rsquo;s voice, without, in conversation with some one
caused them all to look towards the door. In the panel
of light falling on the darkness before the house they
perceived the engineer&rsquo;s tall figure by a horse, from
which the rider was dismounting. Letting the reins drag
and leaving the horse to stand, the latter walked with
Weir into the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, this is a delightful surprise!&rdquo; the engineer exclaimed
on beholding the four who had come while he was
out. &ldquo;And unexpected.&rdquo; His eyes rapidly interrogated
the different faces. &ldquo;I suppose it&rsquo;s business, not pleasure,
that brings you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; said Johnson, the rancher, nodding.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Madden is here on business, too, it seems.&rdquo;
He glanced at Mr. Pollock. &ldquo;Mr. Madden is our sheriff
and he has a warrant for my arrest.&rdquo; He turned back
to the officer. &ldquo;You come at a bad time for my affairs.
You saw that big show at the old house half way down
the road? That crowd is made up of my workmen, who
are being entertained with free whiskey, and there&rsquo;s no
telling but what they may come here to tear things up.
The whiskey is furnished by Vorse, I suspect, and is being
served at Vorse&rsquo;s place. Your warrant is inspired
by Vorse and others, isn&rsquo;t it? The two circumstances
coming at the same moment, the free drunk and my arrest,
look fishy to me. What do you think? I&rsquo;m in
charge of a property here representing a good deal of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242' name='page_242'></a>242</span>
money and I should hate to be absent if the men took
the idea into their heads to turn the camp upside down,
especially if the idea was inspired by Vorse and his
friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t served the warrant yet,&rdquo; Madden replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you know that I&rsquo;m not going to skip the country
at the prospect of your serving it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. There&rsquo;s no hurry; I&rsquo;ll just sit around for
a while. And understand, Weir, this arrest is none of
my doings, except officially. I take no stock in the
yarn about your having attacked the greaser you killed.
Martinez&rsquo; and Miss Janet&rsquo;s testimony at the inquest
satisfied me in that respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pollock now drew Weir aside for a whispered conference.
When they rejoined the others the engineer
made the lawyer acquainted with the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Weir has agreed to my suggestion to take you
into our confidence, Mr. Madden,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;There
may be other warrants for you to serve soon, and I&rsquo;m
sure you will respect what we reveal. All of us here except
you know the facts I&rsquo;m about to relate; indeed,
have shared in them to an extent; and in addition to our
word we&rsquo;ll present proof. You know Dr. Hosmer and
his daughter certainly, you probably know Mr. Johnson
and the young lady with him, and are aware whether
their statements are to be relied on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are,&rdquo; Madden answered, without hesitation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re already convinced of the truth of Weir&rsquo;s innocence
in the charge of murder now being preferred
against him. Well, now, a friend at court is worth something;
and we propose to make you that friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not against him like most of the town, anyway,&rdquo;
was the sheriff&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243' name='page_243'></a>243</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead with your explanation,&rdquo; Pollock said to the
engineer.</p>
<p>Thereupon Weir briefly sketched out events for the officer
as they had occurred and as showing the motives
which had inspired his enemies in seeking to destroy him:&ndash;&ndash;the
original plot against his father, his determination
to uncover the four conspirators, the episode at the restaurant
in Bowenville, the discovery of Ed Sorenson as
the hirer of the dead Mexican assassin, the obtaining of
Saurez&rsquo; deposition and Martinez&rsquo; imprisonment in
Vorse&rsquo;s saloon cellar, Janet&rsquo;s abduction and rescue and
the loss of the paper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the paper isn&rsquo;t lost,&rdquo; Dr. Hosmer interrupted.
&ldquo;Mary Johnson found it and here it is.&rdquo; With which
he drew the crumpled document from his breast pocket
and laid it on the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have it again!&rdquo; Weir exclaimed. &ldquo;You found it,
Mary!&rdquo; He stepped forward and took the girl&rsquo;s hand in
his for a moment. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a friend indeed to bring
this back to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I owed you more than that,&rdquo; she said, coloring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Sorenson has learned about his son and the
paper and everything that happened, except Ed Sorenson
told him lies instead of the truth,&rdquo; Janet put in.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s terribly angry at all of us. He said he would
kill you for crippling Ed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorenson is welcome to try,&rdquo; Weir responded, with a
quick blaze in his eyes.</p>
<p>At this point Mr. Pollock interposed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t finish your story, Weir. Relate for Mr.
Madden&rsquo;s benefit what occurred at Judge Gordon&rsquo;s
house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This tragic conclusion to the afternoon&rsquo;s happenings
the engineer told, though remarking that the company
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244' name='page_244'></a>244</span>
director should be the true narrator. At his announcement
that Judge Gordon had taken his own life by poison
his listeners remained dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead, then?&rdquo; Madden asked, at last.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. And the transfer of property made to Mr.
Pollock amounts to an acknowledgment of his guilt.
Now, I should like to have Martinez read this deposition,
for I&rsquo;ve never heard its contents myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This the Mexican did, translating the Spanish paragraphs
into English with fluent ease, ending by reading
the list of witnesses. Martinez gave the paper a slap of
his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And old Saurez was found dead in Vorse&rsquo;s saloon by
me an hour after he had signed this,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Draw
your own conclusions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madden shifted on his seat. He glanced at the document
and at the others and then gazed out the door at
the darkness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Looks like a clear case; I always imagined if these
men&rsquo;s past was dug into there would be a lot of crooked
business turned up. But granting that everything is as
shown, with Lucerio the county attorney under Sorenson&rsquo;s
thumb and the community as it is there&rsquo;s a question
if Saurez&rsquo; statement even will be enough to convict
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At that Janet jumped up, her eyes gleaming.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not all the proof, not all by any means!&rdquo;
she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What more is there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Johnson&rsquo;s evidence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson&rsquo;s!&rdquo; came in surprised tones from all four
of the men uninformed of the rancher&rsquo;s story.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, he saw the man Dent killed and the plotters make
your father, Mr. Weir, believe he had done the killing.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245' name='page_245'></a>245</span></div>
<p>Steele stared at Johnson dumbfounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Just that; I saw the whole dirty trick worked, looking
through the back door of the saloon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you were the boy!&rdquo; Weir gasped. &ldquo;The boy
who looked in! After thirty years I supposed that boy
gone, lost, vanished beyond finding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stayed right here,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Of course I
kept my mouth shut about what I had seen. I worked
on ranches and rode range and at last got the little
place on Terry Creek and married. Nothing strange in
my remaining in the country where I grew up, especially
as I only knew the cattle business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir swung about to Madden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a live witness,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;With the other
proof his evidence should be final.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whenever you say, I&rsquo;ll arrest the men. As for this
warrant I have, I&rsquo;ll just continue to carry it in my
pocket,&rdquo; the sheriff stated. &ldquo;I must remark that I
never heard of a more villainous plot, taking it all
around, than you&rsquo;ve brought to light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the charges must cover everything,&rdquo; Pollock said
sternly. &ldquo;From Dent&rsquo;s murder to the conspiracy
against the irrigation company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay here in case you need me to stop any trouble
with your workmen,&rdquo; Madden remarked.</p>
<p>But trouble though imminent was coming from another
direction, as was suddenly shown when a man,
dust-covered and hatless, rushed into the office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re on the way,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who? The workmen?&rdquo; Weir demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know anything about the workmen, but
a bunch of Mexicans, fifty or more, are headed this way
to blow up the dam. I saw and heard them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246' name='page_246'></a>246</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;At the spring a mile south. I was watching down
there, where Atkinson had sent me after supper, relieving
the man who kept lookout during the afternoon.
That was where the booze was dealt out last night, you
remember. I was sitting there when I heard a crowd
coming. At first I thought it was our men, but when
they stopped to drink and smoke, I saw by their talk
they were Mexicans. But there was one white man with
them, a leader. He and a Mexican talked in English.
They&rsquo;re to raid the camp, crawling up the canyon, to
dynamite the dam first, then fire the buildings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they&rsquo;re on the road here now?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The speaker licked his lips. &ldquo;I cut along
the hillside until I got ahead of them, but it was slow
going in the dark and stumbling through the sage. They
must be close at hand by this time, though I came faster
than they did. The white man said to the Mexican that
they wanted to reach the dam just at moonrise, and that
will be pretty quick now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the bunk-house and call the men waiting there,
and get a gun yourself,&rdquo; Weir ordered. &ldquo;The storekeeper
will give you one.&rdquo; When the messenger had
darted out, he looked at the others. &ldquo;You must take
these girls away from here, doctor, at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Johnson snapped forth, drawing his
revolver and giving the cylinder a spin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never could hit anything, and haven&rsquo;t had a firearm
in my hand for years, but I can try,&rdquo; Pollock stated.
&ldquo;This promises to be interesting, very interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very,&rdquo; said Weir.</p>
<p>For a little he stood in thought, while the others gazed
at him without speaking. His straight body seemed to
gather strength and power before their eyes, his clean-cut
features to become hard and masterful.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247' name='page_247'></a>247</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Up the canyon he said they were coming, didn&rsquo;t
he?&rdquo; he remarked at last, more to himself than to them.
&ldquo;Very well, so much the better. Johnson, you and Madden
take charge of the men when they come and line
them along the hillside this side of the dam. Put out
all lights.&rdquo; With which he strode out of the building.</p>
<p>They looked after him in uncertainty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going; you may be hurt, and need me,&rdquo;
Mary stated, with a stubborn note in her voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then keep out of reach&ndash;&ndash;and run for town if the
ruffians get into camp,&rdquo; was her father&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay too,&rdquo; Janet exclaimed, resolutely.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h3>NO QUARTER</h3>
</div>
<p>The peril threatening the unfinished dam now alone
engaged Steele Weir&rsquo;s mind. Personal considerations
did not enter into his calculations, least of all thought
of personal danger; for when he placed himself in an
undertaking whatever rested under his hand, as in this
case the irrigation company&rsquo;s property, became for him
a trust to attend, to direct, to guard. Even more than
if it had been his own property did he feel the obligation,
for the interests concerned were not his. But the matter
went deeper than a prospective money loss; it struck
down to principles and rights&ndash;&ndash;the principles of order
and industry as against viciousness and havoc; the rights
of law-abiding men who create as against the wantonness
of lawless men who would destroy.</p>
<p>Were it his own workmen who, inflamed by drink and
incited by a spirit of recklessness, were coming to wreck
the camp in a moment of mad intoxication, he would have
made allowances for the cause. Before resorting to extreme
measures in defending his charge, he first would
have sought to bring them to their senses. Drunken
men are men unbalanced, irrational.</p>
<p>But here was another case: an attack by a secret,
sober, malevolent band, who in cold blood approached to
demolish the company works. Not liquor moved them on
their mission, but money&ndash;&ndash;money paid by his arch enemies.
The men were simply hired tools, brazenly indifferent
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249' name='page_249'></a>249</span>
no doubt to crimes, desperate in character certainly,
for a handful of coins ready to wipe out a million
dollars&rsquo; worth of property and effort. Such deserved
no consideration or quarter.</p>
<p>Weir proposed to give none. With enemies of this
kind he had but one policy, strike first and strike with
deadly force. One does not seek to dissuade a rattlesnake;
one promptly stamps it under heel. One cannot
compromise with ravenous wolves; one shoots them down.
One does not wait to see how far a treacherous foe will
go; one forestalls and crushes him before he begins.
Moreover, if wise, one does it in such fashion that the
enemy will not arise from the blow.</p>
<p>With the information given him by the guard posted
at the spring Weir immediately grasped the true nature
of the plot. The &ldquo;whiskey party&rdquo; was but a means of
withdrawing the workmen from the scene, of weakening
the camp, while a picked company of ruffians wrecked
the property. It was an assault intended to wipe out
the works and end construction, coincident with his arrest.
Both the company and he were to pay the penalty
for resisting the powers that rule San Mateo. And if
the tale were spread that the destruction had been
wrought by his workmen while drunk, who would doubt
it?</p>
<p>Like shadows the band of Mexican desperadoes would
come, dynamite the dam, fire the buildings, stampede the
horses, and like shadows vanish again. In the unexpectedness
of the raid, in the confusion, in the dim light, no
one would with certainty be able to say who the assailants
were. A scheme ferocious in its conception and
diabolical in its cunning! But there was one flaw&ndash;&ndash;the
element of chance. Chance had given Weir warning.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250' name='page_250'></a>250</span></div>
<p>A strong man warned is a strong man armed.</p>
<p>As the engineer stood in the office, swiftly measuring
the imminent menace of which he had just been told,
calculating the meager instruments of defense at hand,
his mind sweeping up all the salient aspects, features,
advantages and disadvantages of the situation, he seized
on the one weak spot in the attacking party&rsquo;s plan. At
that spot he would strike.</p>
<p>So giving Johnson and Madden the order to take
charge of the little handful of guards, he had plunged
out into the night.</p>
<p>The men from the bunk-house were already running toward
the office, before the door of which the rancher
gathered them together to make sure of their arms and
ammunition. All told, when Martinez and Pollock presently
came from the store with guns, the little party numbered
eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this all there are of us?&rdquo; Dr. Hosmer asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are worth all that crowd that&rsquo;s coming,&rdquo; Johnson
exclaimed, taking a spare gun Martinez had brought
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did Weir send the rest of the engineers down to that
house? I understood so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where they are, I reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hosmer considered for a minute.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can be there in five minutes in my car. The road
is on the north side of the stream, as is this camp:
the gang that&rsquo;s heading here to blow things up is coming
up from the south, so it will not block the way.
Men could be here in twenty minutes from down yonder
by running.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good suggestion, doctor,&rdquo; Pollock said. &ldquo;It may
take you a bit longer to find and tell them what&rsquo;s occurring,
but even so they may return in time. Fifty, or
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251' name='page_251'></a>251</span>
even twenty, might give us enough assistance to beat off
the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There comes the moon,&rdquo; said the man who had been at
the spring. &ldquo;They must be near now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Far in the east the moon was stealing above the horizon.
Under its light the mesa took form out of the
darkness&ndash;&ndash;the level sagebrush plain criss-crossed by willow-lined
ditches and checkered by small Mexican fields,
the winding shimmering Burntwood River with its border
of cottonwoods, the narrow road, the distant town of
San Mateo, a vague blot of shadow picked out by tiny
specks of light.</p>
<p>The mountains too now reared in view, silent, silvered,
majestic, towering about the camp on the lower base.
One could see, as the moon swam higher, the low long
buildings of the camp clustered on the hillside above the
canyon, in the bottom of which was the dashing stream
and the bone-white core of the dam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look down yonder on the other side!&rdquo; Martinez exclaimed
suddenly, pointing a long thin forefinger at the
mouth of the canyon where a group of black dots were
moving up the river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s them,&rdquo; said the man who had given the warning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And they&rsquo;re armed,&rdquo; said another. &ldquo;You can see the
moon shine on their gun-barrels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the opposite side of the stream, some two hundred
yards below the dam and three or four hundred feet
lower in elevation than the camp, advancing up the
canyon in a string, the men looked like a line of insects.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m off for help,&rdquo; the doctor said, springing into his
car. &ldquo;Janet, you and Mary go higher up among the
rocks and hide if these buildings are attacked.&rdquo; Away
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252' name='page_252'></a>252</span>
he went, buzzing down the hillside to the long stretch of
road.</p>
<p>Weir now came into sight, walking quickly towards the
group. That he saw the Mexicans down in the canyon
was evident from his swift appraising glances thither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Johnson, move your men down halfway to the dam
and have them scatter there behind bowlders. I shall go
still lower down,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You will hold your fire until
I signal with my hat from the dam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to the dam?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need you. You&rsquo;ll be more effective hidden
above. You&rsquo;ll have plenty of light as the moon is shining
squarely in the gorge. And await my signal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right; you&rsquo;re the general.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But take no extreme risks, Weir. The company
doesn&rsquo;t ask you to sacrifice yourself,&rdquo; Pollock stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sacrifice will be down among those fellows,&rdquo;
Steele replied, with set jaw. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry about me.
Now, start, men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He stood for a little watching the rate of progress of
the line of Mexicans ascending the stream, which was
not rapid owing to the broken rocks lining the bank.
Then he swung about to the two girls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every one here now is under my orders,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;You two will take your car and go at once. This is
no place for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Janet began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking no chances that you shall fall into the
hands of those scoundrels,&rdquo; he declared, sternly. &ldquo;They
may succeed in reaching this spot. You must not be
here; you must go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking each by an arm he piloted them to the car.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_253' name='page_253'></a>253</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Sorry, but it has to be,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;This is work
for men, and men alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet and Mary climbed up into the seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&ndash;&ndash;you will take care of yourself,&rdquo; Janet said,
tremulously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I expect to. Still, this isn&rsquo;t going to be a croquet
party; anything may happen. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he swung about and breaking into a run
made for a small building half-buried in the hillside and
apart from the camp. There he stooped and picked up
under each arm what looked like a cylinder of some size
and went down towards the dam. For a time they could
see him, but all at once he slipped behind an outcrop of
rock and they saw him no more.</p>
<p>Janet turned to eye her companion. Once more her
face was pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she inquired of Mary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I reckon we&rsquo;d better do as he says. He&rsquo;d be awful
mad if we didn&rsquo;t. Did you see his eyes when he talked
to us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But if he&ndash;&ndash;he and others are wounded?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Uneasily Mary gazed at the older girl and then down
at the canyon. On the hillside the men led by her
father were no longer in sight, somewhere concealed
among the stones that dotted the earth. But down by
the stream and now scarcely fifty yards from the white
stretch of concrete barring the river bed through a tunnel
in which the water foamed and escaped, the Mexicans
were clearly visible, their hats bobbing about, their
guns flinging upward an occasional gleam.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t seem as if anything was going to happen,&rdquo;
Mary went on in awed tones. &ldquo;Things are so quiet and
peaceful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Still Janet delayed starting the car, divided in feelings
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_254' name='page_254'></a>254</span>
between a wish to respect Steele Weir&rsquo;s insistent
command and a growing fear for his safety. She could
see nothing of him. Into the shadow of a rock he had
disappeared and thither she gazed with straining eyes,
hoping to see again his straight strong figure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look down there at the dam,&rdquo; Mary said, whose
eyes had been wandering from, point to point of the
scene. &ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t that him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet&rsquo;s heart gave a quicker beat, then seemed to sink
in her breast as staring downward she recognized the engineer.
He had come out all at once from the shade
cast by a wooden framework. He had with him the burdens
he had lifted from the ground before the little detached
stone house at the edge of the camp, and these,
the cylinders, he placed on the surface of the concrete
core at the spot where he stood. Then he knelt down,
struck a match, lighted a cigar&ndash;&ndash;as if any man in his
senses would stop to smoke in such a situation!&ndash;&ndash;and
busied himself at some task over the cylinders.</p>
<p>Only for an instant had he stood erect on the flat top
of the dam. Apparently he had been unseen by the
attackers, engaged in picking their footing: and now in
his crouching position, retired from the upper edge of
the dam&rsquo;s front as he was, it was very likely that he
was wholly out of view of the band.</p>
<p>At last Weir moved his cylinders forward towards this
edge. Afterwards he straightened up and standing
hands on hips, smoking his cigar, the tiny crimson glow
of which rose and fell, he watched the party nearing
the foot of the white gleaming wall, fifty feet below
him.</p>
<p>For Janet the sight was too much. His indifference
to risk froze her; he appeared to be courting death; and
she strove to open her lips to send down to him an imploring
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_255' name='page_255'></a>255</span>
cry to draw back, but succeeded in uttering only
a tremulous wail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll shoot him,&rdquo; Mary was saying, &ldquo;oh, they&rsquo;ll
kill him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A surge of terror swept Janet. Next thing she knew
she was out of the car and running down the hillside
among the stones and the stalks of sagebrush, frantic to
reach him, to pull him out of view of the men beneath.
Only a single one of them had to cast a glance upward
and to raise his gun and fire, then he would die. He
should not die! She should fling herself as a protection
before him rather than that he should be slain!</p>
<p>On a sudden a hand reached up from a rock and seized
her arm, stopping her with a jerk. Then she was
roughly pulled down beside it. The man was Madden,
the sheriff.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What in hell are you doing?&rdquo; he demanded harshly.
&ldquo;Have you gone crazy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>His grip was not relinquished.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But see him! Aren&rsquo;t you men going to help him?
Are you going to let him be killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madden forced her to her knees, so that she was sheltered
by the outcrop of stone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Any man who can smoke a cigar like that at such
a time as this knows just what he&rsquo;s doing,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;Keep quiet and watch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t want to see,&rdquo; she said. But she continued
to look with fascinated eyes at the lone, calm
figure on the dam.</p>
<p>Presently Madden pushed his gun forward over the
rock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve caught sight of him,&rdquo; he stated.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h3>THE THUNDERBOLT</h3>
</div>
<p>The greater part of the number of bandits had
stopped in a group a few yards from the base of the
white dam core, though a few stragglers were some way
behind. Among these Steele Weir made out the figure
of one whom he recognized as a white man; he whom
the guard from the spring had mentioned as directing
the company; and when at a number of exclamations
from Mexicans who perceived the engineer the man lifted
his face, Weir saw he was Burkhardt.</p>
<p>No more than this was needed to show whose the hand
behind this treacherous conspiracy. Clear, too, it was
that Burkhardt, determined that no mistake or abandonment
of the operation should occur, had come to see it
through in person. Weir could ask nothing better; he
had one of the plotters caught in the act.</p>
<p>Apparently orders had been to carry through the first
part of the diabolical plan of destruction in silence, that
of gaining control of the dam, for when two or three
Mexicans flung up rifles to shoot at Weir a sharp word
from another Mexican, seemingly their leader, had
checked the volley and shouted to Burkhardt.</p>
<p>The latter had stopped; he stared for a few seconds
at the man on the white wall above and finally signaled
with a wave of his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down here,&rdquo; he ordered.</p>
<p>But Weir made no move to obey. He continued to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_257' name='page_257'></a>257</span>
stand motionless, coolly regarding the party beneath.
His eyes particularly considered two men who carried
wooden boxes, square and stout, on their shoulders. At
last he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come down, then you&rsquo;ll learn,&rdquo; Burkhardt shouted
up, making no effort to hide the enmity in his voice.</p>
<p>Weir puffed at his cigar, removed it from his lips to
glance at its glowing end, while the Mexicans stared up
at him in silence, puzzled by this lone guard who carried
no rifle, who did not flee away to spread an alarm and
seek aid, and who so unexpectedly had appeared as if
anticipating their visit.</p>
<p>Murmurs broke out. Why were they not allowed to
shoot him at once in the approved Mexican bandit fashion
and proceed to their work? If he were not shot at
once, he yet could escape for aid. The party had to
ascend the hillside in order to mount to the top of the
concrete work. Time would be required to place and
fire their charges of dynamite&ndash;&ndash;and they were eager to
get at the loot in the buildings above.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kill him,&rdquo; Burkhardt roared suddenly, jerking forth
his revolver and blazing at the engineer.</p>
<p>The bullet sang past Weir&rsquo;s head. He did not duck;
indeed, kept his place calmly while the Mexicans were
raising their guns, as if to show his supreme contempt
for their power. But at the instant Burkhardt fired
again and a dozen rifles blazed he sprang back and
dropped flat, leaving the deadly missiles to speed harmlessly
above the dam.</p>
<p>Raising himself cautiously he seized the end of a fuse
projecting from one of the canisters and held the crimson
end of his cigar against it until a sputter of sparks
showed that it had caught. From this fuse he turned
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_258' name='page_258'></a>258</span>
to the one in the second can and repeated the operation.</p>
<p>This was the essence of his plan of defense. With
guns the defenders on the hillside would be outnumbered
and probably killed in an attack. The information that
the assailants were to steal up the canyon, however,
was the key that would unlock a desperate situation, and
his mind had grasped the mode and means of defeating
the enemy.</p>
<p>With the first shots quiet had returned. The night
seemed for Weir as peaceful as ever, the earth bathed
in moonlight, the camp at rest. Only before him there
was the sputter of the two fuses, one at the right, one at
the left, as the trains of fire burned towards the holes
in the canisters. He watched these calculatingly. His
cigar no longer of service had been cast aside.</p>
<p>All at once he rose erect again. A few men were starting
along the wall to climb the hillside, but the greater
number were gathered about Burkhardt and the Mexican
leader. Now Weir glanced at them and now at the
fuses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I warn you to leave this dam and camp, Burkhardt,&rdquo;
he shouted, when a few seconds had passed. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say
I didn&rsquo;t give you warning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every head jerked upward at this surprising reappearance
and voice. They had supposed him fled, the
men down there, and were having a last hasty conference,
doubtless as to the wisdom of now first attacking
the camp. A grim smile came on the engineer&rsquo;s face.
Their astonishment was comic&ndash;&ndash;or would have been at a
moment less perilous and fraught with less grave consequences.</p>
<p>An oath ripped from Burkhardt&rsquo;s lips. An angry
curse it might have been at Madden that he had failed
to arrest and hold the engineer according to plan. He
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_259' name='page_259'></a>259</span>
gestured right and left, yelling something to the men
around him. He himself began to run towards one end
of the dam.</p>
<p>Weir stooped, picked up one of the canisters, blew on
the fuse now burned so near the hole. Some men perhaps
at this instant would have quailed for their own
safety and at the prospect of hurling death among others.
For death this tin cylinder meant for those below.
But there was no tremor in Steele Weir&rsquo;s arm or heart.</p>
<p>He was the man of metal who had won the name &ldquo;Cold
Steel&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;calm, implacable, of steel-like purpose. With
such enemies he could hold no other communion than that
which gave death. For such there was no mercy. By
the same sort of law that they would execute let them
suffer&ndash;&ndash;the law of lawlessness and force. Destruction
they would give, destruction let them gain.</p>
<p>He straightened. He took a last look at the snapping,
sparkling, smoldering fuse, then flung his burden full
down upon the spot where the Mexicans were again pointing
their guns at him. Swiftly picking up the second
canister, while bullets whined by, he cast it down after the
first. A glimpse of startled faces he had, of men attempting
to scatter from before the huge missiles, then
he flung himself full length upon the dam.</p>
<p>Interminably time seemed to stretch itself out as lying
there he listened, waited, sought to brace himself for
the impending shock. A quick doubt assailed his mind.
Had the charges failed.</p>
<p>All at once the earth seemed rent by a roar that shook
the very dam. Followed instantly a second volume of
sound more terrific, more blasting in its quality, more
dreadful in its power, deafening, stunning, as if the world
had erupted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Their dynamite!&rdquo; Weir breathed to himself.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_260' name='page_260'></a>260</span></div>
<p>His ear-drums appeared to be broken. His hat was
gone. His body ached from the tremendous dispersion
of air. But that he could still hear he discovered when
through his shocked auditory nerves he distinguished, as
if far off, faint booming echoes from the hills.</p>
<p>He got to his knees, finally to his feet. Pressing his
hands to his head he gazed slowly about. Stones and a
rain of earth were still falling, as if from a meteoric
bombardment. About him he perceived sections of woodwork
shaken to pieces, collapsed.</p>
<p>Stepping to the edge of the dam he peered downward.
A vast hole showed in the earth before the wall though
the wall itself was uninjured and only smeared with a
layer of soil. Huge rocks lay where there had been none
before, uprooted and flung aside by the explosion, dispersed
by the gigantic blast. On the hillside half a dozen
men were picking themselves up and struggling wildly to
flee. Nearer, a few other forms lay in the moonlight
mangled and still, or mangled, and writhing in pain. Of
all the rest&ndash;&ndash;nothing.</p>
<p>Almost completely Burkhardt&rsquo;s predatory band had
been blotted out. Weir&rsquo;s thunderbolt had struck down
into its very heart, and it had vanished.</p>
<p>As he turned and walked towards the end of the dam,
he staggered a little. The sight had shaken even his
iron nerve.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h3>WEIR STRIKES WHILE THE IRON IS HOT</h3>
</div>
<p>In his runabout, with Sheriff Madden at his side, and
followed by Atkinson and half a dozen men for guards
in two other machines, Weir sped along the road to San
Mateo. They carried with them Burkhardt, who had
been found stunned and slightly injured, and two Mexican
bandits who had been captured. Those of the party
of attackers yet alive but seriously hurt were being
treated at camp by Dr. Hosmer, while the young engineers,
armed and eager, were scouring the mountain
side for the few Mexicans who had got away.</p>
<p>It seemed a miracle that Burkhardt had escaped death,
but the explanation was found no doubt in the fact he
had started from the spot where the canisters fell and
so at the moment of explosion was outside the area
of its full destruction. To Weir the matter went deeper
than that. Providence appeared to have saved him for
punishment, for the long term of imprisonment he deserved
for his crimes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d much rather have him alive than dead,&rdquo; Steele
had remarked to Madden, when the man was brought up
from the canyon a prisoner.</p>
<p>The tremendous thunder-clap of sound from the camp
had quickened the return of the superintendent and his
men, already reached and warned by the doctor. More,
it had startled even the drunken workmen so that when
some one shouted that the dam had been blown up the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_262' name='page_262'></a>262</span>
debauch came to an immediate end, the house was deserted
and the throng, incited by curiosity and wonder,
went staggering and running for camp.</p>
<p>The first of these had arrived and the rest were tailing
behind for half a mile when Weir and his companions
set out for town, the blinding headlights of the machines
scattering on either side of the road the approaching
workmen. It was not likely many would go
back to the house when they were told at headquarters
how narrowly destruction of the works had been averted
and how their spree had been a move in the plot. Between
shame at being-duped and drowsiness resulting
from drink they would, after a look at the hole blown
in the earth at the base of the dam, want to seek their
bunk-houses.</p>
<p>As they sped towards town Weir and Madden rapidly
made their plans, for the sheriff having witnessed with
his own eyes the enormity of the plotters&rsquo; guilt was all
for quick action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These engineers of yours with us and the other men
Meyers will bring down can be thrown as a guard around
the jail,&rdquo; he stated. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll swear them all in as deputies.
With Sorenson and Vorse locked up along with Burkhardt&ndash;&ndash;and
I&rsquo;ll throw Lucerio, the county attorney, in
with them on the off chance he&rsquo;s an accomplice&ndash;&ndash;there
will be high feeling running in San Mateo. As quick as
I can make arrangements, we&rsquo;ll take them to safe quarters
elsewhere&ndash;&ndash;to-night if possible, to-morrow at the
latest, in fast machines. These men have friends, remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve Burkhardt handcuffed; it might be well to
gag him, too, for fear the crowd might make trouble if
he yelled for help,&rdquo; Weir replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, we&rsquo;ll do that, though I think we can rush him
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_263' name='page_263'></a>263</span>
into the jail before anyone knows what&rsquo;s happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the outskirts of town therefore the cars stopped.
When Burkhardt, who had recovered his senses and with
them a knowledge of his plight, perceived the sheriff&rsquo;s
intention his rage burst all bounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fool, you muddle-headed blunderer!&rdquo; he exclaimed,
with a string of oaths. &ldquo;Take these cuffs off!
You&rsquo;ll lose your job for this trick. When I see Sorenson&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When you see him, you&rsquo;ll see him; and that will be
inside a cell,&rdquo; was the cool rejoinder. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know
you were a dynamiter and would-be murderer until to-night,
but I watched you at work and saw you shoot
twice at Weir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll unlock these, I say, here and now!&rdquo; And the
raging voice went off in a further stream of biting curses.
&ldquo;Look at me; I&rsquo;m Burkhardt. You&rsquo;re crazy to talk of
throwing me in jail, with my influence and&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your influence be damned,&rdquo; was the imperturbable
answer. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have a long time in a penitentiary to
see how much influence you have, if you don&rsquo;t swing
first.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Burkhardt struggled fiercely for a moment against
the steel bands about his wrists and the men who held
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No crook like this Weir shall ever send me behind
bars, or any other man put me there. Wait till Sorenson
and Vorse and Judge Gordon learn what you&rsquo;re trying!
Wait till they find out you&rsquo;ve double-crossed us
for this engineer! Wait till Gordon turns me loose with
a <i>habeas corpus</i>, you&rsquo;ll sweat blood for this night&rsquo;s work,
Madden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff shook out the red handkerchief with which
he expected to bind the prisoner&rsquo;s mouth.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_264' name='page_264'></a>264</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wait for a long time if I wait for Gordon to issue
the writ,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;Seeing that he&rsquo;s dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dead! You&rsquo;re a liar, you sneaking cur; you can&rsquo;t
bluff me. And when I&rsquo;m loose, if I don&rsquo;t fill you full
of lead it will be because&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Burkhardt&rsquo;s explanation was never finished on
that point, for Madden whipped the rolled handkerchief
over his mouth and quickly knotted it behind, shutting
off the flow of seething vituperative speech. If looks
could slay, those he received from the prisoner&rsquo;s bloodshot
maddened eyes would have dropped the sheriff in his
tracks; as it was, they fell harmless against the law officer&rsquo;s
person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Things have changed sort of sudden, haven&rsquo;t they,
Burkhardt?&rdquo; Madden stated, sardonically. &ldquo;Never can
tell what&rsquo;s going to happen between supper and breakfast.
Here I go out to serve a warrant on Weir, and
instead I&rsquo;m bringing you in for trying a low I.W.W.
trick. Surprising cards a fellow sometimes gets on the
draw.&rdquo; With which he went back to the other car.</p>
<p>Counting on quickness for the safe delivery of his
men in jail, Madden did not attempt to approach the
court house by a side street. On the contrary he drove
fast down the main way, with the other two cars following
close, passing without pause through the crowd
of Mexicans drawn forth in wonder at the booming report
of the explosion that had sounded from the dam.</p>
<p>One could see that excitement was at a high pitch.
With the rumors that all day had been in circulation,
with later vague tales of the great debauch proceeding
at the old &rsquo;dobe house half way up the road to camp,
with the thunder-clap that had burst from the base of
the mountains coming on top of all, every man, woman
and child had run to the main street, where those in the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_265' name='page_265'></a>265</span>
automobiles could see by wagging tongues and gesticulating
hands that speculation was rife and curiosity
afire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The talk this evening when I set out for your camp
was that I expected to bring you in and hang you,&rdquo;
Madden said dryly, to the engineer. &ldquo;Quite a crowd had
come to town. Plain to see now that Burkhardt and his
bunch had started the talk. I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised
if there had been trouble had I arrested and locked you
up. There are a few bad Mexicans around these parts
that would do anything for money, and it&rsquo;s evident from
what&rsquo;s happened that Sorenson&rsquo;s gang was ready to go
the limit. What I&rsquo;m trying to figure out is where these
fellows Burkhardt had with him up yonder came from.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you. From across the line. I&rsquo;ve seen
plenty just like them down there,&rdquo; Weir affirmed. &ldquo;Look
at their hats and clothes&ndash;&ndash;but you&rsquo;ll be able to make
them talk after a while. However, you won&rsquo;t find any
of them speaking English. Offer one of them some
money and a trip home and he&rsquo;ll give you the story quick
enough, especially after you&rsquo;ve thrown a scare into him.
We can afford to let one go to get the facts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You better keep out of sight after we have the men
in the jail. Slip behind the jail to the rear of the yard,
and when I&rsquo;ve locked them up and told Atkinson what
to do about keeping the people away from the building,
I&rsquo;ll join you there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I understand,&rdquo; Weir stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And we can slip off and grab Vorse if he&rsquo;s in his
saloon and then Sorenson before any one knows what&rsquo;s
happening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; don&rsquo;t want the game spoiled now. Here
we are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cars had arrived at the gate before the courthouse.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_266' name='page_266'></a>266</span>
Here, too, however, the crowd was densest, having
gathered at the spot as if the roar of powder from
the camp was an overture to Weir&rsquo;s arrest and appearance.
It had proved a prelude to his appearance, at any
rate. The crowd perceived him with Madden and it believed
him a prisoner even if not handcuffed and marched
with a pistol at his head.</p>
<p>A profound silence at first greeted the party as it
alighted. Madden, assisting Burkhardt to alight, pulled
the man&rsquo;s broad-brimmed hat low over his eyes to conceal
his face from the revealing moonlight. A short
struggle again ensued, but Burkhardt finally yielded to
the pressure exerted by his companion guards.</p>
<p>A murmur of astonishment ran over the surrounding
throng, each instant being augmented by the voices of
others running to the place. Not only did it appear
that the engineer was under arrest, but likewise others,&ndash;&ndash;a
handcuffed, gagged man and two sullen Mexicans,
strangers to the community. Yet a number of the onlookers,
possibly men with Vorse&rsquo;s or Sorenson&rsquo;s money
in their pockets, shouted as the new-comers moved
through the press:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Killer, murderer! Hang him, shoot him!&rdquo; And
more voices began to join in the cry.</p>
<p>Clearly the intent was to stir up feeling in the crowd
to a point where action against Weir would seem a
spontaneous outbreak. Even women joined in the cry;
curses followed; fists were shaken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open up the way,&rdquo; Madden ordered, as a surge of
the crowd threatened to surround him and his party.
In his hand, as if to emphasize his command, a six-shooter
swung into view, sweeping to and fro and menacing
the press of people.</p>
<p>The frightened men directly before the party struggled
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_267' name='page_267'></a>267</span>
to get out of line of the weapon, yielding suddenly
a clear passage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! Around the courthouse and back to the
jail,&rdquo; Madden exclaimed to those with him.</p>
<p>Pushing forward from the moonlight into the shade
cast by the cottonwoods, they dragged their prisoners
past the first building towards the low stout stone structure
at the rear, half-illuminated and half-concealed
by the patches of light and shade falling from the
trees.</p>
<p>A minute later Madden whipped out his keys.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Two men remain here at the door and don&rsquo;t be afraid
to show your rifles to that bunch,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In with
you, Burkhardt; there&rsquo;s a nice soft stone floor to sleep
on. Keep those Mexican camp-burners covered, Atkinson,
till I get the cells open. You, Weir, slip on back
there in the shadow and wait for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The engineer had taken but three steps into the gloom
along the outside jail wall, glancing about to avoid any
curious straggler of the crowd already hurrying around
the court house towards the jail, when he heard a call.
In the advance was a slim well-dressed Mexican, full in
the moonlight and very important of bearing. The call
was directed not at Weir but at Madden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You got him all right, sheriff?&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes. He came in with me,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But who are these others?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Step inside and I&rsquo;ll tell you, Lucerio.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The county attorney joined the sheriff, peered inside
the doorway and hesitated. It was dark within; no light
showed except a patch of moonlight at the far side of
the building that fell through a barred window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go right in,&rdquo; Madden exclaimed. And laying hand
on the other&rsquo;s shoulder he forced him ahead. The door
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_268' name='page_268'></a>268</span>
closed after the pair. Before the doorway there remained,
however, the pair of young engineers, rifle in
hand, whose threatening bearing and glistening gun-barrels
were apparent even in the patchy light dropping
through the boughs. At a distance of about ten feet off
the crowd of people halted, staring eagerly at the jail
building, showing their white teeth as they carried on
low talk in Spanish and awaiting with impatience the return
of Madden and Lucerio that they might flood them
with questions.</p>
<p>Weir remained to see no more, for the increasing crowd
pushed out further and further on the flanks, a circumstance
that would eventually result in his discovery. So
slipping to the rear of the jail and keeping well in the
shadows he gained the fence. This he leaped and, lighting
a cigarette, examined his pistol, then proceeded to
smoke calmly until Madden arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurry; slip away,&rdquo; the latter said. &ldquo;They wondered
what the devil I dodged back here for and are coming,
curious as cats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two men glided away, keeping well in shadows
until they gained the side street and thence passed to
the main thoroughfare.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What if Sorenson and Vorse are somewhere in that
crowd?&rdquo; Madden asked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re likely to be, expecting
your arrest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll have to wait till they leave it. But I
don&rsquo;t believe they&rsquo;re there. They won&rsquo;t want to show
their hand even by being on the scene.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably they&rsquo;ve found out Gordon is dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Probably. But on the other side, they suppose now
that the dam has been destroyed and that I&rsquo;m locked
up,&rdquo; Weir said. &ldquo;Still, I&rsquo;ll guess that if they&rsquo;ve learned
Pollock and Martinez and I were at Gordon&rsquo;s all the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_269' name='page_269'></a>269</span>
afternoon, and he committed suicide, they&rsquo;ll be worrying
some just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madden glanced at his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe we&rsquo;ll bring Vorse in&ndash;&ndash;alive,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way I want him, and Sorenson, too. I
want to see them go up for life, but if not that then
hanged. But a life term for both, along with Burkhardt,
is my choice. I want them to suffer as my father
suffered. Only worse. Dying&rsquo;s too easy for them. Let
them have hell here for awhile before they get it on the
other side. Let the iron bars and stone walls kill them.
I hope they live for twenty years to gnaw out their
hearts every day and every night behind steel doors.
That wouldn&rsquo;t half pay what they owe. But if they
finish in prison, knowing there&rsquo;s no hope, knowing I&rsquo;ve
put them there for what they did to my father and Jim
Dent, knowing that all the money and cattle they stole
had slipped through their fingers, that they&rsquo;ve lost all
they gained and more, that their curses and crimes are
crushing their own heads, why, that will help. And
Sorenson&ndash;&ndash;Sorenson there every day knowing his son lies
a helpless cripple, without the money that has been piled
up for him! I couldn&rsquo;t invent a worse hell for him.
And that&rsquo;s the hell he&rsquo;s going to have!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though a man not easy to move, Madden at Weir&rsquo;s
cold implacable expression of hatred shivered slightly.
Sorenson and his accomplices would be lucky indeed if
they died by the rope.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h3>VORSE</h3>
</div>
<p>Across the main street the two men walked, wearing
their hats low and making no answer to shouted questions
of those hurrying to the courthouse yard. Already
the grounds about the court house and the street
in front were jammed with eager, excited Mexicans,
thrilled with an expectation of something to happen,
though they knew not exactly what. The murderer, the
killer, they have taken the killer, was the constant statement
tossed from mouth to mouth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But not the killer they think,&rdquo; Madden said, in a low
aside to Weir as they moved ahead on their errand.</p>
<p>The pair were now advancing toward the saloon, along
the opposite side of the street where a slight shadow afforded
them concealment. By the time they came opposite
the building they had escaped altogether from the
crowd, though looking thither over shoulder they could
see the black press of people in the moonlight at the public
building; and here the street was empty except for a
few belated women and children running toward the
assemblage.</p>
<p>Madden&rsquo;s hand suddenly gripped the engineer&rsquo;s arm as
they were about to step forth from the shadow to cross
the street to the saloon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There he is,&rdquo; the sheriff whispered.</p>
<p>Vorse had pushed open the slatted door of his place
and stepped outside. In the moonlight his figure and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_271' name='page_271'></a>271</span>
face were clearly visible: his thin whip-cord body and
predatory face, and bald head as shiny and hard as a
fish-scale. He wore no coat, while his vest hung unbuttoned
and open as usual. About his waist was an
ammunition belt carrying a holster, as if he were prepared
for action.</p>
<p>Thus he stood for a time, hands on hips, motionless,
his cruel hatchet-like face directed towards the scene
further along the street. Presently a man came running
to him, Miguel, his bartender, who had been one
of the two men serving out whiskey to the workmen at
the old adobe house and who at the break-up of the
spree had hastened back to town to report to his employer.
Now, it seemed, he had fresher news to give.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, it is the engineer, for a certainty,&rdquo; he exclaimed
panting, as he stopped before Vorse. &ldquo;The sheriff arrested
him and he now lies in jail there. It is said he
fought and tried to shoot Madden, but that the sheriff
was too quick and shot the gun out of his hand. It is
said also that the dam is blown into a million little
stones, but men are riding there on horses to see for
themselves. They will soon return. Anyway a fight
there was up there undoubtedly, for Madden brought in
not only the engineer but three other men, bound and
handcuffed and struggling furiously, trying to strike and
bite the crowd like mad dogs. From time to time the
sheriff had to beat them on the heads with his pistol,
especially the engineer, who is the worst. I did not see
them, but those who did said their faces were streaming
with blood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. Go find Jos&eacute; Molina and &lsquo;Silver&rsquo;
Leon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are they not up in the hills with their bands of
sheep?&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_272' name='page_272'></a>272</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No. They are here. Look around till you find
them; then send them to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That means something lively to happen, eh?&rdquo; Miguel
said with a laugh.</p>
<p>He did not wait, however, for an answer, but set off
at once for the court house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope Meyers shows up soon with more men,&rdquo; Madden
said to Weir. &ldquo;Those two sheepherders of Vorse&rsquo;s
are a pair of snakes; he always hires that kind; and they
probably have some fellows with them like themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Meyers is on the way with twenty men or so by this
time. They had to come in wagons, as we had the cars.
Atkinson ought to be able to stand off the crowd
with the half dozen boys he has until the others arrive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While they had conducted this brief exchange of
opinions they had kept their gaze on the saloon-keeper,
who continued to stand before his door. The cold and
merciless character of the man was never more revealed
than now as he waited for his hired assassins to come
to receive orders. Possessing already a full knowledge
of the plot, Weir and Madden were able to guess what
culmination was now contemplated and measure the true
depth of the conspirators&rsquo; infamy. The sheriff especially
boiled with inward wrath that they should expect
to make him not only a dupe but a tool in their
crime.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s clear they never intended you should come to trial
when arrested,&rdquo; he said to his companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly not. That isn&rsquo;t the way they play the
game. And I suppose Vorse there imagines the cards
are all falling his way at this moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. Now then!&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_273' name='page_273'></a>273</span></div>
<p>Weir struck off across the street, striding forward at
a pace Madden found it difficult to keep. As they neared
the door, Weir loosened the gun in his holster.</p>
<p>In this action the sheriff imitated him and then changing
his mind drew the weapon itself. Plain man that he
was, he was an instinctive judge of character; he had
encountered men of Vorse&rsquo;s type before, less shrewd but
equally savage; their nature was to fight, not surrender;
their way was to kill or be killed in the final issue. He
anticipated no arrest.</p>
<p>He felt no necessity, however, to express this view to
the engineer, who had proved himself in the time he had
been at San Mateo wholly competent to deal with any
situation that arose. Moreover, while Vorse had had a
reputation of being a quick shot in the past, he was
confident Weir was his master.</p>
<p>With a quiet movement the engineer pushed open the
door and stepped into the saloon. Madden following
him had allowed the slatted door to swing shut again and
the sound of its hinges caused Vorse, who was just starting
away from the bar, to turn about. In his hand was
a tray holding a bottle of whiskey, a bottle of mineral
water and glasses, which apparently he had just lifted
up.</p>
<p>For a space of ten seconds or so he remained unmoving,
the tray in his hand and his eyes regarding the
visitors fixedly. Behind him in the rear of the saloon
a second man had sprung up from the table where he
sat, but after that first startled action he, too, had not
stirred. The man was Sorenson.</p>
<p>With Madden at his side and with a grim smile on his
lips Weir walked slowly towards Vorse. In his tread
there was something of the quality of a tiger&rsquo;s, the light,
deliberate, poised advance, the easy and dangerous movement
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_274' name='page_274'></a>274</span>
of body, the effortless glide of a powerful animal
ready to spring and strike. His hands swung idly at
his sides, but that did not mean they would not be swift
once they responded to the call of the brain that controlled
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You gentlemen were just about to celebrate my downfall,
I perceive, by pouring a libation,&rdquo; Weir said.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let me interrupt. Only I must request you to
conduct the proceedings there where you&rsquo;re standing,
Vorse, instead of at the rear of the room: Madden and
I wish a good view of the ceremony. If Mr. Sorenson
will be so agreeable as to step forward, you may go
ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson did not join Vorse, but instead he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why haven&rsquo;t you locked up your prisoner, Madden?&rdquo;
he demanded harshly. &ldquo;And you&rsquo;re letting him keep his
gun. Don&rsquo;t you know enough to disarm a murderer and
throw him into jail when you arrest him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t arrested him yet,&rdquo; was the sheriff&rsquo;s answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, do it then. You have the warrant for the
scoundrel. Perhaps you haven&rsquo;t heard he almost killed
my boy Ed last night&ndash;&ndash;and you&rsquo;re allowing him to walk
around with you as if he were a bosom friend. Do your
duty, or we&rsquo;ll get a sheriff who will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m here, to do my duty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t have to bring this man here to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I decided to bring him, however.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From Vorse had come not a word. Only his gleaming
evil eyes continued to rest on the two men without wink
or change. For him explanations were unnecessary; he
had divined instantly that somewhere, somehow the plotters&rsquo;
plans had gone awry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did you know that Gordon is dead?&rdquo; Weir asked, all
at once.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_275' name='page_275'></a>275</span></div>
<p>Vorse lowered the tray to the bar and ran the tip of
his tongue over his lips.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we didn&rsquo;t know it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He deeded his property over this evening and then
swallowed poison,&rdquo; the engineer stated. &ldquo;He saw the
game was up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t make me believe your lies,&rdquo; came sneering
from Sorenson. &ldquo;And you shall pay, you and that girl,
for every broken bone in my boy&rsquo;s body. I&rsquo;ll spend my
last dollar for that if necessary. Madden, do your duty
and lock him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The sheriff said nothing, but lifted his gun a little.
Vorse by a slight movement of his body had edged from
the bar as if to gain freedom for action.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The game&rsquo;s up for you men too,&rdquo; Weir said.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve murdered and robbed and swindled in this country
long enough; I&rsquo;ve got the proof and I&rsquo;m going to remove
you from this community. It&rsquo;s not I who will be
arrested. You killed Jim Dent after cleaning him out
at cards and then made my father believe he was guilty
of the crime. All I fear is that the court will hang you
instead of sending you up for life; that would be too good
for you. I want your crooked souls to die a thousand
deaths within stone walls before you die in body. The
game&rsquo;s up, I say. I&rsquo;ve Saurez&rsquo; deposition and I&rsquo;ve the
man who was the boy looking in the back door there
that day thirty years ago and saw you shoot Dent, and
he&rsquo;ll go on the stand against you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A stillness so profound that one could hear the tiny
insects hovering about the lamps succeeded this statement.
If words had not been enough, Weir&rsquo;s cold, harsh
face would have removed the men&rsquo;s last hope, for on it
was not a single trace of relenting. A stone could have
been no flintier.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_276' name='page_276'></a>276</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo; Vorse inquired softly.</p>
<p>His arched bony nose appeared thinner and more
hawk-like. His lips were compressed in a white scornful
smile, while his eyelids now drooped until but slits
of light showed from the orbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you may be interested to know Burkhardt and
some of the Mexicans he hired are now locked up in
jail; the rest, or nearly all, are dead,&rdquo; Weir continued,
with slow distinctness. &ldquo;Your little scheme to blow up
the dam and burn the camp failed. We caught Burkhardt
at the spot leading the gang. Your plot to make
the workmen drunk and leave the dam unprotected
worked well enough so far as that part was concerned,
but a keg of powder dropped on your bunch of imported
bandits ended that part of the show. And we have
Burkhardt! You gentlemen are going to join him in the
jail, where we shall give you all the care and attention
you deserve.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vorse turned his head about towards Sorenson.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madden, you&rsquo;ve too much sense to believe all this
trumped-up libel!&rdquo; Sorenson exclaimed furiously.
&ldquo;About us, respected leaders of this town! Arrest the
blackguard!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even facing assured proof of his complicity and guilt,
the cattleman still believed in the power of his wealth
and influence, in his ability to browbeat opponents, to
command the man he had elected to office, to dominate
and ruthlessly crush by sheer will power all resistance,
as he had done for years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take no orders from you,&rdquo; the sheriff replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I suppose I can empty the till and lock the safe
before going?&rdquo; Vorse questioned.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_277' name='page_277'></a>277</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No. Keep in front of the bar where you are,&rdquo; the
sheriff commanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And have everything stolen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your bar-keeper will be back presently. He will
look after things for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say Burkhardt is locked up?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will hurt his pride,&rdquo; Vorse laughed. &ldquo;He always
swore that no one should put him behind bars. He
wouldn&rsquo;t have minded so much finishing in a gun-fight,
but to serve a term in prison would surely go against the
grain with Burk. Though I think with Sorenson&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir&rsquo;s eyes had never left the speaker. Through the
other&rsquo;s inconsequential talk and apparently careless acceptance
of the fact of arrest the engineer had noted the
tense gathering of the man&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put your hands up,&rdquo; he interrupted at this point.</p>
<p>Vorse had uttered no following word after speaking
Sorenson&rsquo;s name; his voice terminated abruptly. At the
same instant his right hand flew to his holster and
whipped out his gun. It was the advantageous time for
which he had waited, for Madden&rsquo;s look which had been
moving back and forth from Vorse to Sorenson so as to
cover both had passed to the latter. And Weir&rsquo;s weapon
was undrawn.</p>
<p>But if Vorse drew fast, the engineer&rsquo;s motion was like
a flash of light. His weapon leaped on a level with the
other&rsquo;s breast. The report sounded a second before that
of Vorse&rsquo;s and three before Madden&rsquo;s, who also had
fired.</p>
<p>Then, if ever, Steele Weir had displayed his amazing
speed in beating an enemy to his gun, for Vorse had indeed
been quick, keyed by a knowledge that for him this
meant imprisonment or freedom, a slow death or liberty.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_278' name='page_278'></a>278</span></div>
<p>For a minute he stood half crouching as he had been
at the instant of shooting, his eyes glaring balefully at
his enemy and the thin cruel smile on his lips, while the
two men in front stood warily waiting with weapons extended.
Then Vorse clutched at his breast, muttered
thickly and toppled over full length on the floor.</p>
<p>The sharp pungent smell of powder smoke mingled
with the reek of liquor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s dead,&rdquo; Madden said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you hit?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. His bullet went past my hip; he never got his
gun up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madden glanced about towards the rear of the room.
A command for Sorenson to stop broke from his lips.
Next he fired. And Weir swinging his look that way
saw Sorenson&rsquo;s form, untouched by the bullet, vanishing
through the rear door into the night. Using the minute
that the two men&rsquo;s surveillance had been lifted he had
escaped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hard luck when we had him,&rdquo; Weir growled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t get away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not so sure. And he&rsquo;s armed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll strike for home to get his car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or to the office for money,&rdquo; Weir exclaimed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h3>THE FOURTH MAN</h3>
</div>
<p>A last look Steele Weir had at the dead man on the
floor before he turned to go in search of Sorenson. Not
so astute or crafty as Judge Gordon, nor so intelligent
as Sorenson, nor so belligerent as Burkhardt, he had
been as rapacious and infinitely more cool-minded than
any of the three. If anything, he was the one of them all
to proceed to a crime, whether fraud or murder, in sheer
cold blood and by natural craving. No uneasy conscience
would have ever disturbed his rest: no remorse or
pity ever stirred in his breast. He was the human counterpart
of a bird of prey.</p>
<p>Well, he was dead now. Three of the quartette who
had been joined by avarice and lawless actions were taken
care of&ndash;&ndash;Burkhardt a prisoner, Gordon dead by self-administered
poison, Vorse by bullets. Almost did Steele
Weir feel himself an embodiment of Fate, clipping the
strands of these men&rsquo;s power and lives as with shears.
Sorenson alone remained to be dealt with and his freedom
should be short.</p>
<p>Beckoning Madden, he went swiftly through the door
where the cattleman had leaped into the shadows. Where
the gloom ceased and the space behind the row of store
buildings was clear in the moonlight, nothing was to be
seen. Naturally the man had kept within black shade
in his flight.</p>
<p>When they reached the rear of the cattle company&rsquo;s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_280' name='page_280'></a>280</span>
office building, they peered in through its barred back
windows, but all was dark inside the structure so far as
they could determine. To all appearance Sorenson had
not stopped here: it was quiet, gloomy, untenanted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to try his home now,&rdquo; the sheriff stated.
&ldquo;If we don&rsquo;t find him there, we&rsquo;ll set the telephones going
to warn all the ranches and towns around to be on
the lookout and either to stop or report him if he shows
up. He hasn&rsquo;t start enough to get away now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They hastened on along the line of buildings until they
reached a side street. But when they had proceeded a
short way, Weir stopped.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not satisfied about the office,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Suppose
you go on to his house and I&rsquo;ll return for a look inside
from the front. If you fail to find him join me at Martinez&rsquo;
office, where no one is likely to be around and we
can then lay further plans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That suits,&rdquo; Madden responded, and set off alone.</p>
<p>Weir&rsquo;s alert brain had been turning over the possibilities
of Sorenson&rsquo;s course. Rather by pursuing what
would be the man&rsquo;s line of reasoning than by depending
on chance, he had come to the quick decision to turn
back once again to the office. Sorenson would so act as
would best serve his immediate escape and that of the future.</p>
<p>Would he expect the sheriff and the engineer to look
for him to flee by the speediest means, an automobile,
and to the natural avenue of escape, the railroad? Yes.
Therefore on that expectation he would adopt another
way to throw off pursuit. And perilous as a delay would
be in getting away from San Mateo, yet he must risk the
few minutes necessary to get money. For to fly with
pockets empty meant eventual, certain capture. Money
a fugitive from justice must possess above everything
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_281' name='page_281'></a>281</span>
in order to possess wings; and no one would know that
better than Sorenson.</p>
<p>Though Madden and he had seen no light in the office
building, the cattleman nevertheless might have been
within. If he had been in the vault, he could safely have
lighted a candle without their perceiving its beams; and
though the safe was modern it probably had no time lock.
Sorenson could unlock it with a few twirls of the combination,
stuff his pockets with currency and negotiable
paper to the amount of thousands and then slip away.</p>
<p>Fortunately the moonlight was to Weir&rsquo;s advantage.
He quickened his steps, passed round the corner into
the main street and moved towards the building. For
him the crowd at the court house at that moment had
no interest; one person, and one person alone, commanded
his thoughts.</p>
<p>How correct had been his logic&ndash;&ndash;logic not unmixed
with intuition, perhaps&ndash;&ndash;appeared when he was yet some
fifty yards away from the door he sought. A tall bulky
figure suddenly stepped forth from the building and instantly
ran across the street and lost itself in the shifting,
jostling crowd that was half-disclosed, half-concealed
by the broken shadows of the moonlit trees.</p>
<p>Steele Weir proceeded to a spot near the office and
halted. His first impulse to rush after Sorenson had
been promptly suppressed, as cooler judgment ruled. To
seek his quarry in that throng would be labor wasted,
while to reveal his identity would be to court a disastrous
interference with the business at hand. From where he
stood he should much better be able to see Sorenson when
he did emerge, unless he chose to remain in the crowd or
steal away at the rear of the court house yard, a chance
Weir must take.</p>
<p>Five minutes passed. The restless, talkative Mexicans
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_282' name='page_282'></a>282</span>
continued to swarm and buzz with excitement, ceaselessly
moving about, forming and reforming in groups, agitatedly
repeating newer and wilder rumors concerning
events. Despite Weir&rsquo;s intent watch for Sorenson, the
engineer could not but observe the mob&rsquo;s manifestations,
observe them with sardonic humor. For their ebullition
of the present would be nothing to what it would be if
they learned he stood across the street, uncaged, unfettered,
free and armed, a &ldquo;gun-man&rdquo; loose instead of
a &ldquo;gun-man&rdquo; in jail.</p>
<p>All at once Weir noted out of the tail of his eye a
slight stir among a number of horses standing with reins
a-trail before a store a little way down the street. The
horses were partly in the light, partly in the shadow,
so that all he could see was that one or two of them
had jerked aside quickly, then resumed their listless postures.</p>
<p>He was about to withdraw his eyes when he saw a man
swing upon the back of one of them and start off at
an easy canter. Weir sprang towards the spot at a run.
That big figure could only be Sorenson&rsquo;s, for no Mexican
he had ever seen in San Mateo could match it. And the
plan of escape showed the other&rsquo;s craft in an emergency;
gradually working his way through the crowd he had at
last gained the protective shadow of the building on that
side of the street and slipped along in it until he reached
the horses.</p>
<p>Doubtless the man had conceived the plan at the instant
he had stepped from his office, sweeping the street
by one gauging look. With the whole town assembled
at the court house, his departure was little likely to be
noted by the Mexicans, while Madden and Weir would
never suspect him of riding off on a horse, or suspect too
late. Indeed, he rode at first as if in no great haste,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_283' name='page_283'></a>283</span>
but as he turned his mount into a narrow by-way, more
a lane than a street that disappeared between two mud
walls, Weir saw him strike his heels into the pony&rsquo;s
flanks.</p>
<p>But for the startled movement of the nearby horses
when Sorenson took stirrup, Weir would not have looked
that way. He might possibly have seen the horseman
start off, but that is not certain. He unquestionably
would have supposed him an ordinary rider if he had not
noticed the man until he reached the mouth of the lane.</p>
<p>Meantime the engineer had made his best speed to the
line of waiting horses. Slowing to a walk so as not to
scare them, though as he discovered on examination most
of them looked too bony and spiritless for that, he approached
and carefully inspected the bunch. He took
his time in the selection: the more haste in choosing a
mount might prove less speed in the end. He tightened
the saddle-girths and ran a finger along the head straps
of the bridle of the horse picked to judge their fit, receiving
a snap from the pony&rsquo;s teeth, which gave him
satisfaction. Not only was this animal a wiry, tough-looking
little beast, but he had life.</p>
<p>Up into the saddle Weir went, followed Sorenson&rsquo;s
line to the lane, down which he swung. Coming out into
the next street, he pursued it to an intersecting street,
and there galloped for the edge of town without trying
to guess the way taken by his enemy. Once he reached
the open fields he would quickly get sight of the man racing
away somewhere on the mesa.</p>
<p>Evidently the quarry he pursued had not taken so
direct a course as Weir, for when the latter at length
came forth where he could have a wide view he perceived
the horseman a quarter of a mile off and further east,
galloping south. The engineer at once raced thither to
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_284' name='page_284'></a>284</span>
gain the same road and turning into it made for Sorenson.</p>
<p>Thus the two men sped away from San Mateo. The
wire fences and the adobe houses of Mexicans owning
little farms adjoining soon ceased. The wide mesa lay
on either side. Though a quarter of a mile had separated
the men when Weir first observed the other, the distance
between had been increased while the engineer was
gaining the road, until now the interval was almost twice
as great.</p>
<p>Weir guessed the fleeing man&rsquo;s plan. Instead of seeking
the railroad for the present, he would disappear in
the mountains, where with the assistance of some loyal
employee, cowman or sheepherder, he would lie hid until
the first fury of the hunt had subsided. Possibly his
bold brain even conceived the idea of again returning to
San Mateo some dark night soon and further looting the
office, vigilance being relaxed.</p>
<p>In any case, he would expect to remain safe from pursuit
in a mountain fastness until either on horseback or
by automobile he could work his way out of the country.
With what he had unquestionably carried off he would
not be a poor man. In some spot far away he could
assume a new name, start in business and later be joined
by his wife and crippled son.</p>
<p>Alas, for those plans, arising like mushrooms on the
ruins of his life! Behind him followed the same inexorable
antagonist who so swiftly had brought everything
crashing about his head. Possibly Sorenson once out of
the town had failed to look back; possibly looking back
he had been unable to distinguish against the blur of
houses and trees the horseman galloping in the moonlight
along the same road.</p>
<p>But all at once when they were two miles away from
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_285' name='page_285'></a>285</span>
San Mateo he discovered Weir, who had been gradually
cutting down the space between until now again he was
within a quarter of a mile of his quarry. Sorenson had
been riding rapidly but not hard; he now beat his horse
to a furious gallop,&ndash;&ndash;a good pony, too, from its speed,
showing that the banker as well as Weir had picked his
mount with care.</p>
<p>Weir did not urge his horse to a similar pace, only
maintaining a fast steady gallop that kept the other in
sight though the space between again widened. Apparently
Sorenson realized the folly of attempting to outrun,
his pursuer at once, for he soon dropped back into
a regular, mile-eating gallop. Gradually in turn Weir
crept up to his old position.</p>
<p>To each the only sound was that of drumming hoof-beats.
In front rode the fleeing man&ndash;&ndash;dethroned leader
and criminal and murderer. Behind relentlessly came
his Nemesis, the son of the man whom he had deceived
and damned to mental suffering. All about them as they
flew along was the silent, moonlit, sage-covered mesa.
At their right towered the misty, unchanging peaks, as if
watching unmoved this strange race of two human beings.
A strange race, in truth,&ndash;&ndash;a race where vengeance rode.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h3>THE VICTOR</h3>
</div>
<p>Ten miles the two men had gone when Sorenson&rsquo;s horse
began to fail. The rider&rsquo;s weight was proving too much
for the sturdy little animal and though he strove to maintain
his speed the strain told on lungs and legs. Weir
had reduced the distance first to three hundred yards,
then to two hundred, and at last but a hundred separated
him from the man and horse ahead.</p>
<p>The hard chase indeed was beginning to tell on his
own mount. Flecks of foam flew from its lips; its neck
was wet with sweat; the whistle of its breath was audible
to the engineer at every stride. For as both men had
realized that now the end could not be far off, they had
pushed their horses to faster and faster galloping.</p>
<p>On a sudden Sorenson swung his animal into a dim
trail leading from the main road skirting the mountain
range to the base of the mountains themselves. The first
slopes were but a mile away, covered with a scattering
growth of pinyon pines. Just in front, too, for which
the trail seemed pointing, was a dark ravine filled with
brush that rose to the denser timber above. This was
the fugitive&rsquo;s goal. Once he could fling himself from
the saddle and plunge into the undergrowth he would
be safe from his pursuer.</p>
<p>The two ponies struggled on with exhausted leaps.
Weir had reduced the interval to seventy-five yards by
the time half the distance was covered and to fifty as
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_287' name='page_287'></a>287</span>
they drew near the mouth of the ravine. He measured
his gain and the remaining two hundred yards or so with
savage eyes, then drew his revolver. He desired to take
Sorenson unharmed. But rather than that the man
should escape he would kill him.</p>
<p>Sorenson&rsquo;s horse stumbled, but a jerk of the reins
saved him and kept him moving on. The engineer struck
his own pony fiercely on the flank, which produced a tremendous
effort in the striving beast that brought it
within thirty paces or so of Sorenson. That, however,
was the best it could do, labor as it would. Its knees
were trembling at every stride, its head swinging heavily.</p>
<p>Sorenson&rsquo;s horse suddenly went to its knees. But the
man leaping clear took the ground on his feet and instantly
set off at a run for the line of brush in the draw
some seventy or eighty paces away. A last spurt Weir&rsquo;s
pony made, bringing his rider to within thirty yards of
the cattleman, who glancing over his shoulder halted,
swung about, fired a shot and again started to run.</p>
<p>The pony under Weir came to an abrupt stop, shaking.
He was done, whether from exhaustion or the bullet
the engineer did not wait to see. Flinging himself out
the saddle he raced after his man, taking the rough trail
leading up the slope in swift strides. On foot Sorenson
was no match for him. But the latter had the start; he
was now almost within reach of the thick screen of
bushes; and he bent every energy to make the ambuscade.</p>
<p>Still running, Weir flung up his gun and fired. Close
the shot must have gone to Sorenson, so close as to
inject into the man&rsquo;s mind recollection of his pursuer&rsquo;s
accuracy and a fear of a bullet in his back, for when
within twenty feet of the bushes he dropped behind a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_288' name='page_288'></a>288</span>
small bowlder, whence he fired twice at Weir but without
striking his mark.</p>
<p>Neither man after the furious ride and the concluding
run on foot was fit for sure marksmanship. This Weir
realized, so stopped where he was some forty feet off
from Sorenson&rsquo;s stone in order to regain his breath and
calm his nerves. Of the cattleman he could see nothing;
the man crouched low out of sight, perhaps reloading his
weapon, perhaps steeling himself for a dash across that
small moonlit space that separated him from safety, or
perhaps preparing for a quick upward spring and a
fresh volley directed at his foe.</p>
<p>It may be questioned if in his heart Sorenson was not
almost disposed to fight the matter out. He was no
coward; his original hatred for the engineer had by
recent events been swelled to a diabolical desire to kill;
and now even if he, Sorenson, succeeded in slipping away,
his whereabouts would be known unless he destroyed the
man. Safety demanded that he not only escape but
escape without this witness.</p>
<p>Weir had not sought cover. He stood upright, his
revolver ready, trusting to have an advantage in his
speed when it came to an exchange of shots. Then he
began an advance, a slow noiseless circling advance that
at the same time of taking him closer to his enemy
brought him round on his flank.</p>
<p>Sorenson&rsquo;s hand and pistol appeared and half his face
while three shots rattled from his gun, two at the spot
where Weir had been and one at him in his new position,
which the hiding man had immediately located. The last
shot ticked the engineer&rsquo;s sleeve. In return Weir fired
twice, the first bullet striking the rock and ricocheting
off with a loud whine, while the second struck the pistol
from Sorenson&rsquo;s hand.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_289' name='page_289'></a>289</span></div>
<p>Instantly Weir sprang forward.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show yourself,&rdquo; he ordered. And the kneeling fugitive,
disarmed, gripping his bleeding hand, sullenly arose
to his feet. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve led me a chase, but I have you at
last,&rdquo; the engineer continued. &ldquo;Now you&rsquo;re going back
to San Mateo and jail. Walk towards the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson cast one bitter glance at the thicket in the
ravine; by only the little matter of a few yards he had
failed to gain liberty. For Weir his visage when he
looked around again was never more hard, hostile, full
of undying hatred. Though balked, he was not submissive,
and was the kind who kept his animosity to the end.
Then he started off towards the horses, his own which
had staggered to its feet again and Weir&rsquo;s, both standing
with hanging heads and heaving, quivering sides.</p>
<p>All at once the cattleman halted and faced about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most men have a price, and I suppose you have
yours,&rdquo; he said, with forced calmness. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ready to
pay it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to pay it,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How much will you ask to let me go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you offered me ten million, which you haven&rsquo;t got,
I wouldn&rsquo;t accept it,&rdquo; Weir said, harshly. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t
enough money in the world to buy your liberty. You&rsquo;re
going back to San Mateo, and from there to the penitentiary
or to the gallows, one or the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be neither,&rdquo; Sorenson stated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re mistaken, but I shall not argue the matter
with you. Keep walking towards the horses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorenson&rsquo;s lips became compressed. He glanced down
at his bleeding hand, shook the blood from his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I stay here,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>Weir went a step nearer and thrust his face forward,
jaw set, eyes smoldering.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_290' name='page_290'></a>290</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;Go on, I say,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>But the other did not retreat before him or indeed
move at all. A sneer lifted his gray mustache.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a gun; you&rsquo;re a killer; here I am unarmed
and in your power,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You intend to take me
in; I propose to stay here. If I go to San Mateo, it
will be as a dead man. I&rsquo;ll see whether you have the
nerve to shoot me down where I now stand. If you have,
go to it. You can then take my body to town, but I&rsquo;ll
not have paid the price you name and I&rsquo;ll have the
satisfaction of knowing I beat you at the last&ndash;&ndash;in that,
at least. Your bragging will be empty. Start your
shooting any time you please.&rdquo; The tone spoke complete
contempt.</p>
<p>Weir said nothing. The defiance, the supreme audacity
of this assertion, coming so unexpectedly, surprised
him and left him at a loss. He would not kill an unresisting
man, even Sorenson, his worst enemy. Sorenson
in his place probably would not have hesitated to do
so, for he had no fine scruples in such matters; but for
Steele Weir the thing was no more possible than striking
a woman or a child.</p>
<p>It was not a question of nerve, as the other had stated.
It was a test of brutality and consciencelessness. To
shoot a man while escaping is one thing; to kill him
while a prisoner, however contemptuous and brazen, was
another. But there are means other than bullets for
handling obstinate prisoners.</p>
<p>Weir shifted his weapon so as to grasp the barrel and
have the butt free.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave your execution to the proper officials, if
an execution is what you want,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Now will
you go?&rdquo; he demanded, threateningly.</p>
<p>His foe gazed at the clubbed pistol and turned as if
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_291' name='page_291'></a>291</span>
to yield. Next instant he whirled, lunging at Weir and
flinging his arms about his captor. An exultant exclamation
slipped from his lips; his hot breath fell on the
engineer&rsquo;s cheek; his eyes glared into those of the man
his arms encircled. He had tricked Weir by his pretense
of obstinacy, led him to weaken his guard and
had him in his grasp.</p>
<p>Weir braced himself to resist the man&rsquo;s effort to force
him down. Strong arms the other had, now doubly
strengthened by hate and a belief in victory. All the
power of Sorenson&rsquo;s great body was exerted to lift him
off his feet, crush him in a terrific bear-hug, put him on
his back and render him helpless; and Weir in his turn
was tensing his muscles and arching his frame with every
ounce of his lean, iron-like frame.</p>
<p>Thus they swayed and struggled in the moonlight,
without witnesses. A sinister silent fight, marked only
by their fierce breathing and fiercer heart-beats. The
pistol had dropped from Steele Weir&rsquo;s hand; instead of
attempting to break the other&rsquo;s hold he had yielded to
it and pushing his own arms forward had clasped his
hands behind Sorenson&rsquo;s back in the wrestler&rsquo;s true defense
to such an attack.</p>
<p>Once Sorenson almost had him on his knees, but by a
quick powerful upthrust of his legs he regained his upright
position. However, it had been a close shave for
Weir, for he well knew that his opponent would use any
tactics, fair or foul, to kill him if he once lay on his back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hound from hell!&rdquo; Sorenson snarled. &ldquo;You
crippled my boy, and you shall die for that. You&rsquo;ve
ruined me in San Mateo, and you shall die for that. You
jailed Burkhardt and poisoned Gordon and shot Vorse,
and you shall die for that. I&rsquo;m going to choke the life
out of you, and grind your dead head into the dust, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_292' name='page_292'></a>292</span>
then spit on you. That&rsquo;s how I treat snakes. Say your
prayers, if you know any, for you&rsquo;ll never get another
chance. Your friends won&rsquo;t recognize your remains
when I&rsquo;m done with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Venomous and impassioned, all the hate in the man&rsquo;s
heart flowed forth in a fuming stream. For hate and
murderous desire was all that was left him in the wreck
of life caused by the engineer. If he could no longer
rule, he could at least destroy.</p>
<p>Weir had made no response to the fierce imprecations.
He was working his hands upward, straining his arms
so as to reach Sorenson&rsquo;s head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When the coyotes are gnawing your skull,&rdquo; Sorenson
went on, raging, &ldquo;when the worms are feeding on
you&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words died in a gurgle of pain. Weir&rsquo;s hands had
closed about his temples, a finger sunk in each eye, forcing
his head back. Sorenson shook himself frantically
to break the torturing hold. His head went farther and
farther back as if it seemed his neck would snap; his
mouth opened to gasp, &ldquo;Oh, God!&rdquo; and all at once his
hug slipped apart.</p>
<p>Instantly Weir tripped him, falling on top. Reaching
out like a flash he seized his pistol lying on the
ground and brought it down on the head of his enemy,
who momentarily blinded and suffering could not resist.
Sorenson went limp. From the savage beast of a minute
before he had been changed to a huge, motionless, sprawling
figure, with face upturned to the moon.</p>
<p>And on that face the victor of the life and death
struggle could still behold, through the contorted lines
stamped by pain, the man&rsquo;s brutal passion and fixed malevolence.</p>
<p>Weir arose.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_293' name='page_293'></a>293</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;You felt the hound of hell&rsquo;s teeth,&rdquo; he muttered.</p>
<p>With thongs from one of the saddles he bound Sorenson&rsquo;s
hands, pulling the knots tight and hard. The prostrate
man moaned, opened his eyes. Weir jerked him
dazed and staggering to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up into the saddle with you if you don&rsquo;t want another
rap on the head,&rdquo; Steele ordered, bruskly. &ldquo;And
go straight this time. From now on I&rsquo;ll take you at your
word and put a hole through your black heart if you
try any more tricks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When his prisoner was mounted, he fastened his ankles
together by another thong under the belly of the pony.
Weir was taking no chances. Up into his own saddle
then he swung himself.</p>
<p>No exultant curses now came from his captive&rsquo;s lips.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h3>A FINAL CHALLENGE</h3>
</div>
<p>The hour was drawing near midnight when Weir and
his prisoner entered the town. Most of the women and
children of the crowd of Mexicans had gone to their
homes, but men yet remained before the court house and
in the street, discussing and arguing the exciting events
of the night.</p>
<p>In some mysterious manner knowledge that Burkhardt
and not Weir was the prisoner in the jail, together with
news of Judge Gordon&rsquo;s suicide and Vorse&rsquo;s death, had
spread from mouth to mouth. Amazement and incredulity
had been followed by an aroused feeling of anger,
for to the Mexicans it appeared that the crushing blow
dealt the leaders of the town was the arbitrary act of
the man they believed a lawless gun-man. Were not
Weir&rsquo;s foremen and engineers guarding the jail? Men
who were strangers, not even citizens of the county?</p>
<p>But though an undercurrent of feeling ran among the
talking groups, gradually increasing as the time passed,
yet was there no active desire on the part of all or a
concerted movement to drive away the seeming invaders
of the law. For any such attempt a strong leader was
necessary. There was none: Madden frowned upon
them, only saying as he moved about that he was executing
the law; Sorenson, the dominating figure of the
town, and Burkhardt&rsquo;s, Vorse&rsquo;s and Gordon&rsquo;s friend, was
strangely absent.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_295' name='page_295'></a>295</span></div>
<p>The determined guard about the jail was in itself a
deterrent to mob action. Meyers had brought twenty
or more men from camp, armed and alert, who with those
already about the building constituted a force to make
any crowd of Mexicans, however angry, think twice
before seeking to rescue prisoners. But the wish and
the spirit were not lacking. Employees of the plotters,
men who had received favors from Sorenson or Vorse or
Burkhardt, Mexicans of a naturally vicious and unruly
temper, were all for rushing the jail. The great number
of the people, however, peaceful and indolent, preferred
to content themselves with satisfying their curiosity
by talk instead of seeking a taste of blood. And so as
a result of this divided opinion the hostility for Weir had
not expressed itself in an effort to assail the keepers of
the jail.</p>
<p>When he was discovered to have returned to town,
this angry feeling assumed a menacing form. He approached
the court house by the side street, Sorenson
riding at his side, for it was his plan to lodge his prisoner
in the Jail with as much secrecy as possible. Nevertheless
in this he was disappointed; men saw him arrive,
assist his prisoner to alight and climb the board fence
about the yard; and drawn by the expectation of new
events the nearer groups hastened forward.</p>
<p>Weir impelled his man towards the jail.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stand back,&rdquo; he commanded the Mexicans.</p>
<p>The latter at first stared in astonishment at beholding
the pair, one of whom was San Mateo&rsquo;s foremost citizen,
now sullenly advancing with wrists bound. Exclamations
burst from their lips.</p>
<p>At that a flash of hope filled Sorenson&rsquo;s breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my rescue, friends!&rdquo; he cried, beginning to
struggle.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_296' name='page_296'></a>296</span></div>
<p>Weir jerked him ahead fiercely and cast fiercer looks
at the Mexicans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This man is under arrest. And remember I can still
shoot straight,&rdquo; he warned.</p>
<p>Towards him came Madden running, who in Weir&rsquo;s
disappearance earlier in the night he had guessed a pursuit
of the cattleman and had therefore returned to the
jail. He placed himself at Sorenson&rsquo;s right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whoever tries to take Sorenson from the hands of
the law does so at his own peril,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>A few mocking shouts resulted. These were gradually
increased until the Mexicans, now being joined by scores
of others from the street, became a howling, cursing, hysterical
mob, crying Sorenson and Burkhardt&rsquo;s innocence,
calling down imprecations on the heads of the sheriff
and the engineer, stirred by certain lawless spirits to
wilder and wilder passion.</p>
<p>Weir and Madden had not been standing still, for the
crowd was not yet numerous enough at first or bold
enough to attack. Moreover the two men held their
pistols well in view. Forcing Sorenson ahead, driving
apart those who blocked their way, they pushed across
the yard until but a few paces from the jail.</p>
<p>One Mexican, a ranch hand from one of Vorse&rsquo;s
ranches, wearing a great high-peaked felt hat and chaps,
insolently thrust himself before the trio, spitting at
Weir&rsquo;s face and in Spanish begging companions to help
him release Sorenson. His right hand was resting on his
holster as if but awaiting an excuse to use his gun.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Get to one side,&rdquo; was Weir&rsquo;s harsh order.</p>
<p>The man&rsquo;s answer was a string of foul curses. Like
a panther the engineer leaped forward and struck the
fellow on the side of his head with revolver barrel,
dropping him where he stood.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_297' name='page_297'></a>297</span></div>
<p>As the crowd remained suddenly mute, unmoving, their
howls checked by this swift reprisal, Weir spoke to
Madden:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick! To the door!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Each with an arm in Sorenson&rsquo;s, they made a run for
the jail, passed through the line of armed guards and
for the moment were safe. The sheriff lost no time in
dragging the prisoner inside and when presently he
stepped forth again, locking the door after him, he
showed a relieved face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I put irons on him, hands and feet,&rdquo; he informed
Weir. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s out of the way at any rate if we&rsquo;re in for
a row.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was exactly what appeared in prospect. Only
the rifles in the grip of the two dozen men about the
jail kept the now thoroughly aroused mob from
rushing forward. From yelling it had changed to low
fierce murmurs that bespoke a more desperate
mood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to move the men somewhere else,&rdquo; Steele
Weir stated. &ldquo;Pretty soon they&rsquo;ll go for arms and then
we&rsquo;ll have real trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I arranged while you were gone to transfer them to
the county seat in the next county,&rdquo; Madden said.
&ldquo;Telephoned the sheriff; he&rsquo;s expecting them. To-morrow
we can take them to Santa F&eacute;, out of this part of
the country till time for their trial. I placed the automobile
your man brought Burkhardt in from the dam
and another machine back in the alley; they are there
now in the shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good. The quicker you take them, the better. They
ought to be gagged when brought out. Get them here to
the door; the men who are to drive should have the cars
ready, engines going&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_298' name='page_298'></a>298</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s fixed. Your superintendent will drive one
car and one of the engineers the other; they can slip
back there at once. Six more of the guards are to go
with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right. You know whom you want. Station them
here at the door to rush the prisoners back the instant
you&rsquo;re ready. Have them go round to the rear on the
dark side of the jail; they should gain a good start
before they&rsquo;re discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Madden called from the line Atkinson and the men
whom he had chosen to accompany him on the night ride.
A brief parley followed. Then he and two of the engineers
went inside the jail, while the superintendent and
one young fellow stole away in the shadows towards the
spot where stood the cars.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the throng had grown until it filled all the
space about the rear of the court house and formed a
mass of human bodies on which the checkered moonlight
played reaching to within half a dozen paces of the jail.
A shot rang out and a bullet struck the jail. It was
like a match lighted near powder, that if allowed to burn
would set off an explosion. One shot would lead to others
from reckless spirits, to a volley and in the end to an
onslaught.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was the reasoning and the purpose of
the man who had fired. In any case, it must not be repeated.</p>
<p>Weir strode forward towards the crowd.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If that man, or any of you, want to shoot this out
with me, let him show himself,&rdquo; he said, threateningly
and swinging the muzzle of his weapon along the line
of faces.</p>
<p>A quick retreat on the part of those nearest marked
the respect with which it was considered. Frantically
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_299' name='page_299'></a>299</span>
they strove to push further back into the mob, clawing
and elbowing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you try any more shots,&rdquo; he continued, speaking
in Spanish as before, &ldquo;those rifles will open fire.&rdquo; He
paused to allow this information to have full effect.
&ldquo;Finally, if you attempt wrecking this jail, the three
hundred workmen from the dam will march down to San
Mateo and teach you proper observance of the law. If
you&rsquo;re really looking for trouble, those three hundred
men will give this town trouble that will be remembered
for twenty years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Standing there in the moonlight between the two
parties, between the thin line of sentinels about the jail
and the dense mob in front, Steele Weir&rsquo;s action seemed
the height of rashness. A rush of the Mexicans and he
would be overwhelmed, a cowardly shot from somewhere
in the rear and he might be killed. It was like inviting
disaster.</p>
<p>If, however, he recognized his danger, he gave no sign
of it. By the power of his gun and sheer boldness he
faced them, calm, fearless, masterful. His unexpected
advance had surprised the Mexicans, left them confused
and uncertain. Wild and sinister tales concerning his
prowess magnified him in their eyes notwithstanding their
animosity. Now they seemed to feel his iron will beating
against their faces.</p>
<p>During the pause that ensued Weir heard the jail door
open. Madden was preparing to take his prisoners out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not seeking trouble, but I&rsquo;m not avoiding it,&rdquo; the
engineer proceeded, for this was the critical minute, and
he sought to have all eyes focused upon him instead of
upon the activity at his back. &ldquo;The sheriff represents
the law here in San Mateo, and I give you plain warning
that every man who attempts violence to-night will be
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_300' name='page_300'></a>300</span>
called upon to pay the account. By to-morrow the Governor
may have soldiers stationed in your houses and in
your streets, for the prisoners are now the prisoners of
the state, arrested for stealing cattle&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was a happy inspiration. Had Weir stated the
whole category of Sorenson&rsquo;s and Burkhardt&rsquo;s crimes,
including murder and dynamiting, he could not have
struck so shrewdly as in naming the sin of cattle-stealing.
For this was a cattle country and even the most
ignorant Mexican grasped the significance of this charge.</p>
<p>A visible stir answered the statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For stealing cattle from other men&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;he did not
trouble to mention the fact the crime had occurred thirty
years previous&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;and for that and other things Sheriff
Madden has arrested them. Because they are rich, their
guilt is all the worse. Perhaps they have taken cattle
belonging to you, who knows? That may come out in
their trial; if they have taken them, you shall have them
back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the rear of the grounds came the low sounds of
automobile engines being started. Weir dared not look
about to learn if Madden and his party were safely on
their way thither. As for the Mexicans, the speaker&rsquo;s
words had created a sensation. For men were there
who owned small herds now feeding on the range, and
from anger their minds yielded to sudden anxiety; each
saw himself a possible sufferer from cattle depredations;
and in the minds of these, at least, thought of loss supplanted
thought of Sorenson and Burkhardt.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I helped Sheriff Madden arrest these men because
they stole cattle, possibly some of your steers among
them. Is that why you would like to lynch me, as I&rsquo;ve
heard you wanted to do?&rdquo; he demanded, savagely. &ldquo;Because
I save your animals? Or is it because I shot that
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_301' name='page_301'></a>301</span>
renegade Mexican whom Ed Sorenson hired to try and
kill me? Ed Sorenson, yes. Sheriff Madden has the
knowledge of it. Not only would Sorenson the father like
to see me die because I know about his cattle-stealing,
but Ed Sorenson, the son, hired that strange Mexican
to shoot me from the dark because I stopped him from
trying to steal a girl. Has Ed Sorenson left your daughters
alone? I would save your daughters from his evil
hands, as I would your cattle from his father&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A man all at once pushed forth from the crowd, wrathfully
elbowing his way among neighbors. He was
Naharo, the Mexican who had chatted once with Martinez
in the latter&rsquo;s office.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; he shouted, facing his countrymen. &ldquo;I,
Naharo, vow it the truth. For I saw this engineer take
a young girl away from Ed Sorenson in the restaurant
at Bowenville that the scoundrel intended to seduce. It
is so, the truth; the engineer saved her. And are there
not men among you&rdquo;&ndash;&ndash;his voice gained a savage, rasping
note&ndash;&ndash;&ldquo;whose girls have been betrayed by the cattle-stealing
Sorenson&rsquo;s son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is he&ndash;&ndash;where is he now?&rdquo; some one shouted,
angrily. It might have been a father who stood in
Naharo&rsquo;s case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He lies crippled,&rdquo; Weir stated. &ldquo;Last night he tried
to steal yet another girl from San Mateo, and fleeing
when overtaken was pitched from his car and crushed
against a rock. He will steal no more daughters of
San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sensation on sensation. The crowd fairly hummed
with new excitement resulting from these disclosures.
Ed Sorenson&rsquo;s ways were known to most and the revelations
seemed true to his character; and from believing
the statements of the son to accepting those concerning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_302' name='page_302'></a>302</span>
the father was but a step. Cattle&ndash;&ndash;girls! It began to
look as if this engineer was in the right.</p>
<p>With half of his attention Weir was harkening for the
sound of starting automobiles. He had heard the scuffle
of feet when the party slipped away from the jail door
into the shadows. He had almost measured their passage
to the alley. Ah, and now! There was a quick grind of
gears, the pop of exhausts, then a dying of the sounds
as the cars left the grounds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You wished to kill me when you came here, but I had
not then and have not now any intention of dying,&rdquo; he
stated. &ldquo;For I have work to do&ndash;&ndash;and work for you if
you want it. Instead of stealing your cattle and daughters
as the Sorensons did, I&rsquo;ll give you jobs. We are
about to begin digging canals and ditches on the mesa;
I want men and teams&ndash;&ndash;you and yours at good pay for
a good day&rsquo;s work. Our quarrel of the past need not
be remembered. I have never been your enemy, only the
enemy of the four men who deceived and oppressed you.
And now they are gone, two dead and two off to be tried
for their crimes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weir stood for a moment silent, while they as silently
stared at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, bueno, we shall work!&rdquo; Naharo exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall work and build your ditches, se&ntilde;or,&rdquo; cried
a score of voices.</p>
<p>Then the cry swelled to a noisy chorus. The crowd
began to stir and disintegrate and break into groups,
gesticulating, talking, discussing all the astonishing
items of news given by the engineer, from the particulars
of the Sorensons&rsquo; depravity to announcement of renewed
hire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Se&ntilde;or, we hold you in greatest respect,&rdquo; said a man to
Weir, smiling in friendly fashion.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_303' name='page_303'></a>303</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And also your pistol,&rdquo; said a companion, laughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one will need to wear pistols here in San Mateo
from now on,&rdquo; was the answer. And he politely bade
them good-night.</p>
<p>His belief was sincere. San Mateo had gained an end
of violence, and henceforth his weapon would gather
dust. He had triumphed. Not only had he subdued his
enemies, but he had won the good will of the people.</p>
<p>One thing more alone remained to be won to bring
him utter happiness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h3>THE RECLUSE</h3>
</div>
<p>As Weir drove his car homeward through the moonlight,
he knew that at last the dark shadow upon his life
had passed forever. Memories poignant and sad, memories
bitter and stern, returned again and again to his
mind; but these henceforth with time would soften and
change. Of these his last visit to his father was most
vivid, that day in spring that had proved their last
together....</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>He had been there with his father for a week, and
now must go. He was chopping wood that morning, with
his father looking on. Steele had cast a measuring
glance at the pile of wood cut, then wiped the fine dew
of perspiration from his brow, buried the ax blade in the
chopping-log and seated himself upon a sawn block. A
smile shaped itself upon his lips. Though he never
chopped wood now except on these rare visits to his recluse
father&rsquo;s cabin here on the forested mountain side,
his tall lean figure was as tough and wiry as ever, his
arm as tireless, his eye as true to cut the exact line.
There was yet no softening of his fibers or fat on his
ribs, and there would be neither if he had anything to
say about it.</p>
<p>From the little Idaho town in the valley below, which
he viewed through the clearing before the cabin, his gaze
came around to his father seated on the doorstep. Taciturn
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_305' name='page_305'></a>305</span>
and brooding the latter had always been, but the
pity and sorrow struck at the son&rsquo;s heart as he perceived
what a mere shell of a man now sat there, gray-haired,
bent, fleshless, consumed body and soul by the destroying
acid of some dark secret. Even when a lad Steele Weir
had sensed the mystery clouding his father&rsquo;s life. Like
an evil spell it had condemned them to solitude here in
the mountains, until Steele&rsquo;s youth at last rebelled and
he had departed, hungry for schooling, for human society
and for a wider field of action.</p>
<p>What that secret might be he had for years not allowed
himself to speculate. Unbidden at times the memory
of certain revealing looks or acts of his father&rsquo;s
floated into his mind:&ndash;&ndash;a dread if not terror that on occasion
dilated the elder man&rsquo;s eyes, and a steadfast driving
of himself at work as if to obliterate painful and
despairing thoughts, and an uneasy, furtive vigilance
when forced to visit town. Once when a stranger, a
short heavy-set bearded man, had unexpectedly appeared
at the door, his father had leaped for the revolver hanging
in its holster on the wall.</p>
<p>On catching a second view of the chance visitor he had
exclaimed, &ldquo;Not Burkhardt after all!&rdquo; With which he
burst into a wild laugh, the shrill mirthless laugh of a
man suddenly freed of a terrible fear. However, as he
returned the gun-belt to its place, his hand shook so
that he pawed all around the nail on which it was accustomed
to hang.</p>
<p>Steele Weir would never forget that moment of panic,
his father&rsquo;s spring to the wall and following laugh&ndash;&ndash;the
only laugh he had heard from those lips; and though but
twelve years old at the time he could not misread the
episode. On another occasion he found his father kneeling
at the grave under the giant pine beyond the cabin&ndash;&ndash;the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_306' name='page_306'></a>306</span>
grave of the gentle mother of whom Steele had but
dim recollections&ndash;&ndash;and his father&rsquo;s hands were clasped,
his head bowed. With an infinite yearning he had longed
to creep forward and comfort him by his presence, by
a clasp of the hand, but the recollection of his father&rsquo;s
habitual chill reserve daunted him and he stole away.</p>
<p>On his own life the mystery had left its gloomy impress.
A solitary and joyless boyhood, overhung by
he knew not what danger, haunted by a parent&rsquo;s lurking
fear and anguish, had made him a silent, cold, ever watchful
man, never entirely free from the expectation that
his father&rsquo;s sealed past at some instant would open and
confront him with the terrible facts. For that reason
he felt that the success he had gained as an engineer,
a success won by relentless toil and solid ability, rested
on a quicksand. For that cause he had welcomed engineering
projects full of danger and by his indifference
to that danger gained his name &ldquo;Cold Steel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now on this day with his father he once again put
the question he always asked on his visits, and with no
more hope of a consenting reply than before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must be going to-morrow. Won&rsquo;t you come along
with me this time, father? I want you to live with me,
so that I can look after you and be with you. We can
fix up a good cabin at the engineering camp. You&rsquo;re
not so strong as you were; you could fall sick here and
die and never a person know it. I doubt if you spend,
making yourself comfortable, one dollar in ten of the
money I send you. You would be interested in the building
of this big irrigation project I&rsquo;m to direct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father appeared to shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lived here and I&rsquo;ll die
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m afraid of,&rdquo; Steele responded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_307' name='page_307'></a>307</span>
&ldquo;Afraid you may become sick and die for lack of care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I&rsquo;ll remain, my son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was conclusive. It was the answer of not only
thirty years of living at the spot, but of his secret dread.
Steele saw once more the stark fear in his eyes, the fear
of contact with men, of venturing out into the world, of
precipitating fate.</p>
<p>For a time his father plucked his white unkempt beard
with unsteady hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the place you&rsquo;re going this time?&rdquo; he presently
inquired, without real interest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;New Mexico.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the elder&rsquo;s face appeared suddenly a gray shadow
as if the blood were ebbing from his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where in New Mexico?&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The town of San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father struggled to his feet. With one hand he
clutched the doorframe for support. The skin of his
cheeks had gone a sickly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;San Mateo&ndash;&ndash;San Mateo!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;Not there,
not there, Steele! Keep away, keep away, keep away!
My God, not San Mateo&ndash;&ndash;you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swayed as if about to fall full length, gesturing
blindly before his face as if to sweep away the thought,
while his son ran towards him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father, you&rsquo;re sick,&rdquo; Steele exclaimed, putting an
arm about the other. And, in truth, the elder man
seemed fainting, ready to collapse. &ldquo;Come, let me help
you in so you can lie down. I must bring a doctor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele almost carried him to the bed. On it his father
sank, remaining with closed eyes and scarcely breathing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No doctor; bring no doctor,&rdquo; he said painfully, at
last. &ldquo;I feel&ndash;&ndash;I feel as if dying.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_308' name='page_308'></a>308</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;I must bring a doctor. And I have a flask of whiskey;
let me pour you a little to revive your heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The change the words wrought from passivity to
action was startling. The elder Weir arose suddenly on
elbow, glaring fiercely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whiskey, never! It brought me to this, it damned
my life. If it had not been for whiskey&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo; Without
finishing the words he fell back on the bed.</p>
<p>The loathing, the hatred, the utter horror of his exclamation,
banished from his son&rsquo;s mind further thought
of using this stimulant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But the doctor?&rdquo; he inquired, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use, Steele. I&rsquo;ve been the same as a dead man
for days. Just ashes. I want to die; I want to lie by
your mother there under the big pine. And maybe I&rsquo;ll
have peace&ndash;&ndash;peace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele took in his own the wasted hand hanging from
the bed. He held it tight, with a feeling of infinite
tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be yourself again soon,&rdquo; he said comfortingly,
though without faith in the assurance.</p>
<p>His father&rsquo;s lips moved in a whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; my time is here at last,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t go
to San Mateo, Steele,&ndash;&ndash;don&rsquo;t go, don&rsquo;t go. Oh, my God,
spare me that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would you have me break my word? I never have
to any man, father. I accepted this offer and signed a
contract. I&rsquo;m morally bound; these men are depending
on me. Were you ever at San Mateo? Was it something
that happened there that makes you fearful to have me
go? San Mateo is a thousand miles from here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The face before him became like the face of a corpse.
For an instant Steele&rsquo;s heart went cold in the belief that
his father had died under the effect of his declaration.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_309' name='page_309'></a>309</span>
But at last the eyelids raised, the eyes gazed at him.
And all at once the features of the harsh visage seemed
softened, changed, lightened by a dim illumination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see you now as you are, a man, stronger than I
ever was,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I lived in fear, but my fear
was not for myself. Had I been alone, nothing would
have mattered after your mother died. But my fear
was for you&ndash;&ndash;and of you. I was afraid your life would
be blasted; I was in terror lest you should hate and
despise me when you learned the truth. So I sought to
conceal it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had no need to fear that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see it now. Tell me everything or nothing as you
wish about your going to San Mateo to work; it will
frighten me no longer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steele briefly spoke of his new work there, of the
magnitude of the project and the desire he had had that
his father might be with him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud of you,&rdquo; his father said. &ldquo;God knows I
have not been the parent I would or should have been.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s enough for me if your heart&rsquo;s easy now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel as if I were gaining peace at last and&ndash;&ndash;and
I must speak. In San Mateo&ndash;&ndash;ah, Steele, you will hear
of me there,&ndash;&ndash;you may have to fight the damning influence
of my name and past, but I know now you&rsquo;ll come
through it. And all I pray for is that you can retain a
little love for me despite everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whatever it is I shall hear of my father, I should
rather hear it from his lips than from strangers&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hand in his closed spasmodically. For a long
time nothing was said, and the only sound in the room
was the ticking of the tin clock on the shelf busily
measuring off the seconds of the old man&rsquo;s failing span.
To Steele it was as if his father was slowly summoning
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_310' name='page_310'></a>310</span>
the few remaining shreds of his fortitude to reveal the
cancer of his past.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a branded murderer,&rdquo; he said at last, gasping.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never killed a man out of mere wanton desire
to slay,&rdquo; Steele responded firmly. &ldquo;I too have
killed men in fights in Mexico. That fact doesn&rsquo;t weight
my mind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the line of your duty, in the line of your duty.
But I was drunk. He was a friend. When I became
sober, I saw him with a bullet hole in his head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you remember nothing of shooting him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing, nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know you killed him?&rdquo; his son demanded
with inexorable logic. &ldquo;What is the proof?&rdquo;</p>
<p>A low groan escaped his father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men said I had killed him. But my own mind was
blank.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who were the men? Were they present at the time?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They were four&ndash;&ndash;Sorenson, Vorse, Gordon, Burkhardt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were you arrested and tried?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. They helped me to escape. Because of your
mother, they said, and because they said they were my
friends. But I never felt they were really friends. For
they were always against new-comers and wanted to keep
things in their own hands. You were only three or four
years old at that time, Steele, so you wouldn&rsquo;t remember
anything about matters there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What were you doing at San Mateo, father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now that the hideous past at last stood uncovered the
son was able to turn upon it his incisive mind; he would
drag out and scrutinize every bone of the skeleton which
had terrorized his father and shadowed his own life
Facts faced are never so dreadful as fears unmaterialized.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_311' name='page_311'></a>311</span>
And more, he sought with all the love of a son for circumstances
that would mitigate, excuse, or even justify
his father&rsquo;s act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was ranching,&rdquo; was the low answer. &ldquo;I had come
to San Mateo two years before from the east, bringing
you and your mother and considerable money. I bought
a ranch and stocked it with cattle; I was doing well, in
spite of the fact I was new to the country and the business.
Also I was making friends, and I had been nominated
for the legislature of the Territory to run against
Gordon. But I had taken to drinking with the men I
met, other cattlemen, because I fancied no harm in it.
And then while in a drunken stupor I killed Jim Dent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Had you quarreled with him?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Never, never&ndash;&ndash;till that moment I killed Jim. They
said I quarreled with him then. But I remember nothing.
Jim was my best friend; I would have trusted him with
my life. Even now I can&rsquo;t make it seem real I shot him,
though it must be true by those four witnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of your ranch? Your political nomination?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I withdrew from the latter; that was one of the terms
made by Gordon on which they were to help me escape
instead of turning me over for prosecution. And my
ranch and cattle, I had to deed them over to the four
men too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then their friendship wasn&rsquo;t disinterested,&rdquo; Steele
said quickly, with suspicion dawning on his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They weren&rsquo;t really friends, I knew that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were they to arrange your escape?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The senior Weir seemed to shudder at the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By bribing the sheriff and county attorney. I was
then to leave the country at once, never showing my face
again, or I should be arrested. I was still half dazed
by whiskey and terror; I took your mother and you and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_312' name='page_312'></a>312</span>
fled this far, when my money gave out. So here I&rsquo;ve remained
ever since, for here I could hide and here was her
grave.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the last thing you remember of the circumstance
previous to learning Dent was dead?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, though I had been drinking I can remember
clearly up to the time I stopped playing poker with Jim
and the four men, for we were losing and I felt they
were working a crooked deal on us somehow. I asked
Jim to quit also, for though I hadn&rsquo;t lost much he was
losing fast and playing recklessly. But he wouldn&rsquo;t drop
out of the game, and when Vorse and Sorenson cursed
me and said for me to mind my own business I went back
to a table near the rear door and laid my head on my
arms and went to sleep. When I was awake again, Vorse
and Gordon were holding me up by their table and Jim
was dead on the floor. I had come forward, they said,
begun a big row with Dent and finally shot him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the only witnesses were these four men who
were gambling with him, who cursed you when you attempted
to persuade him to drop his cards,&rdquo; Steele proceeded,
&ldquo;one of whom was your political adversary, men
who were old-timers and opposed to new-comers, who
pretended to be your friends but took your ranch and
cattle. It begins to look to me as if they not only killed
your friend Dent but double-crossed you in the bargain.
Did you look in your gun afterwards?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No. I was sick with the horror of the accusation, I
tell you, Steele. I had no way to deny it; it seemed indeed
as if I must have killed him. And from that day
until this I&rsquo;ve never had the courage of soul to reload
my pistol, or even clean it. It hangs there on the wall
with the very shells, two empty, the rest unfired, that it
carried that day in San Mateo.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_313' name='page_313'></a>313</span></div>
<p>Weir sprang up and crossed to the nail where hung
the weapon. The latter he drew from the holster and
broke open, so that the cartridges were ejected into his
hand. For an instant he stared at them, but at length
walked to the bed before which he extended his palm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look&ndash;&ndash;look for yourself!&rdquo; he exclaimed hoarsely.
&ldquo;You never killed Jim Dent; drunk or sober, you never
killed any one. You&rsquo;re not a murderer. You&rsquo;re the innocent
victim of those four infamous scoundrels; they
deceived you, they ruined your life; and their damnable
fraud not only killed my mother in her youth, as I guess,
by grief and despair, but has brought you now to your
death too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His father had raised himself on an arm to gaze
incredulously at the six unfired cartridges lying in
Weir&rsquo;s palm. Then all at once his bearded lips trembled
and a great light of joy flashed upon his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Innocent&ndash;&ndash;innocent!&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Steele, my son,&ndash;&ndash;Helen,
my wife! No stain on my soul!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he sank back Steele&rsquo;s arms caught him. He did
not speak again, but his eyes rested radiantly on his
boy&rsquo;s before they glazed in death. Fear had passed
from them, forever.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h3>UNDER THE MOON</h3>
</div>
<p>Lights still were burning at headquarters when Steele
Weir slowly drove his runabout up the hillside slope to
the dam camp. The men who had acted as guards about
the jail, except those who went with Madden, were somewhere
on the road behind him, returning home in the
wagons. A reaction of mind and body had set in for
Weir; after the previous night&rsquo;s loss of sleep and prolonged
exertions, after the swift succession of dramatic
events, after the tremendous call that had been made
upon his brain power, nervous force and will, he experienced
a strange unrest of spirit. His triumph
seemed yet incomplete, somehow unsatisfying.</p>
<p>It was as he approached the camp that he saw a
slender girlish figure sitting on a rock in the moonlight.
He swung his car off the road beside the spot where
Janet Hosmer sat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, you are still awake?&rdquo; he asked, with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could I sleep while not knowing what was happening
or what danger you might be in?&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Mr.
Pollock said we must not think of returning home until
quiet was restored in San Mateo. One of the engineer&rsquo;s
houses was given to us by Mr. Meyers before he left,
where Mary and I could sleep. But I could not close
my eyes. So much had happened, so much was yet going
on! So I came out here to be alone and to think and
watch.&rdquo;</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_315' name='page_315'></a>315</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;And your father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s attending the wounded Mexicans in the store.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Steel alighted and tossing his hat upon the car seat
gazed out over the mesa, misty in the moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There will be no more trouble,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;Sorenson
and Burkhardt are Madden&rsquo;s prisoners, and on their way
to a place of safe-keeping in another county. Vorse is
dead. The people in town have a fairly good understanding
of matters now, I think.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How in the world did such a change of opinion occur?&rdquo;
Janet exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had a little talk with the crowd and made explanations.
The feeling for me was almost friendly when I
left; what enmity remains will soon die out, I&rsquo;m
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though unaware from Steele Weir&rsquo;s laconic statement
of what had actually occurred, the girl divined that his
words concealed vastly more than their surface purport.
With the general hostility against the engineer that had
existed, for him to swing the community to his side meant
a dramatic moment and a remarkable moral conquest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friends have always known you would win,&rdquo; she
said, smiling up at him.</p>
<p>He seated himself on the rock beside her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s but a short time ago, Janet, that I had no
friends, or so few they could be counted on the fingers
of one hand. Business acquaintances, yes. Professional
companions, yes. Men who perhaps respected my ability
as an engineer, yes. But real friends, scarcely one.
And now I think I have gained some, which is the greatest
satisfaction I have from all that has happened. After
years the pendulum has swung to my side. Do you know
the hour my luck changed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet shook her head wonderingly.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_316' name='page_316'></a>316</span></div>
<p>&ldquo;No, I can&rsquo;t even guess,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, it was that afternoon, and that moment, I
found you sitting in your stalled car in the creek down
there. That was the beginning. From that time things
began to run in my favor and they haven&rsquo;t ceased to do
so for a moment since, I now see looking back over
events. You brought good luck to me that day in your
car.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What an extraordinary idea! Then at bottom you&rsquo;re
superstitious,&rdquo; Janet replied. &ldquo;I shall have to give
you a new name; I must no longer call you &lsquo;Cold
Steel.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really never liked that name,&rdquo; Weir said quickly.
&ldquo;Perhaps I was cold steel once, but I have changed along
with everything else. And you&rsquo;re responsible for that
too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet leaned forward and looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were never truly harsh to any one except those
who deserved it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I know! You would never
have been so quick to help Mary Johnson or me, or
others who needed help, if your heart was not always
generous and sympathetic. Only against evil were you
as steel, and in moments requiring supreme courage and
sacrifice. And that&rsquo;s how you gained the name before
you ever came here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anyway I&rsquo;ve changed,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m out from under
the cloud which I felt always hung above me. As I say,
you brought me good luck that day&ndash;&ndash;and I see clearly
that I shall continue to be superstitious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, all occasion for that is past now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Steele Weir. &ldquo;No, less than ever. For
I&rsquo;m certain you hold my good fortune in your hand yet,
and will continue to hold it. And that means&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He paused, regarding her so intensely that the blood
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_317' name='page_317'></a>317</span>
beat up into her face. There was no mistaking that
look and it thrilled her to the soul.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she managed to say.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It means my happiness, now and for all time to
come,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;See, I shall have accomplished
what I set out to do and what in justice had to be done,
bringing these men to punishment&ndash;&ndash;to punishment in one
form or another. I shall have given my employer, the
company, service worthy of the hire. I shall have rid
you and San Mateo of an unscrupulous parasite in the
person of Ed Sorenson, though my persecution of him
now shall stop and I shall leave him enough out of the
property recovered from his father to live in comfort
somewhere with his mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Pollock states I shall have no trouble in getting
legal title and possession of most of the wealth of these
four men,&ndash;&ndash;I and any relatives of the dead Jim Dent who
can be found. For thirty years&rsquo; accumulated interest
charges owing me will swallow up all the men&rsquo;s properties.
That, however, is only a material victory. I shall
have relieved Johnson of fear of financial constraint;
and saved his daughter from a serious mistake. I shall
have started Martinez on the road to success&ndash;&ndash;and I
should not be surprised if he prospered, became the
leading attorney in this county, was elected judge and
so on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a way, too, I shall have helped to remove the
oppressive weight of these men, Sorenson, Burkhardt,
Judge Gordon and Vorse, with their sinister influence,
from this community and region. They have always
held the natives in more or less open subjection, financial,
political, and moral. There should be a freer air
in San Mateo henceforth. The people will have a chance
to grow. They no longer will feel the threat of brutal
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_318' name='page_318'></a>318</span>
masters always over them; and with the completion of
the irrigation project and the infusion of new settlers
they will become better citizens.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see all this,&rdquo; he concluded. &ldquo;It pleases me; it gives
me cause for satisfaction. But it doesn&rsquo;t give me the
happiness I want, or the love. That is alone in your
hands to bestow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet felt herself trembling; she could not speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think I felt the stirring of love from the moment I
saw you there at the ford,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Last night
when I knew that wretch had carried you off to the
mountains, I could have torn him limb from limb. That
was my love speaking, Janet. If I should have to go
through life without you&ndash;&ndash;oh, the thought is too bitter
to dwell on!&ndash;&ndash;then I should think life not worth living.
But I have imagined that you might have for me a
little&ndash;&ndash;&ndash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Janet swiftly clasped his hand with her own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she cried softly. &ldquo;I was sitting here
when you came because I loved you. If I am necessary
to your happiness, you also are necessary to mine. I
honor you for what you have done and love you for what
you are, a strong true heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Janet, you give me the greatest joy in
the world,&rdquo; he whispered. &ldquo;Love&ndash;&ndash;that is more than
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His arms drew her to his breast. Her lips went to
his in consecration of that love. Their hearts beat the
rapture of that love.</p>
<p>Over the silent peaceful mountains the moon spread
its effulgent light. Over the mesa that was no more to
know the fierce sound of strife. Over the town, at last
free of its avaricious masters, free of the savage spirit
of an outlaw time. Over the Burntwood River flowing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_319' name='page_319'></a>319</span>
in a shimmering band to the horizon. Over the camp
where centered so many men&rsquo;s plans and labors. And
over the lovers, chief of all, that light fell as in a silvery
halo.</p>
